1. Who are you and what are you working on?
   1. I am an engineer on the Polychain team, but come from the Bitcoin world. Used to work at a brokerage. Went back to grad school. Decent amount of experience in Bitcoin and Ethereum stuff over the years. I also have a cryptography background.
   2. Doing a lot of lightning stuff right now, payment channels. Spending a lot of time investing companies in the space, doing due diligence. 
   3. Been deeper into the bitcoin world, a bit of an outsider in Ethereum. 
   4. I built a blockchain analytics tool called blockseer for bitcoin and Ethereum
   5. Taught Bitcoin/Ethereum class at Stanford in 2015
   6. Am really proud of the exchange and brokerage that I built in Taiwan.
1. What are the tools/libraries/frameworks you use?
   1. I don’t do much eth-dev right now.
1. What are your biggest frustrations?
   1. Expenses when running contracts
1. How do you handle testing?
   1. CI pipeline needed. 
   2. Testing and security audits are one and the same since you’re deploying it once. 
   3. Few contracts are heavily audited, and ecosystem is built around those smart contracts.  
1. How do you handle smart contract verification and security?
   1. We refer companies to trail of bits/ other. 
   2. Formal verification handled by specialized firms. Important contracts will/should be audited by people.
1. What tools don’t exist at the moment?
   1. Native chain improvements
      1. Casper
      2. Generalized staking system where you can sell your stake via a new token via smart contracts. Bond for staking.
   1. Programming tool chains for web assembly. Being able to take advantage of multiple languages like C++ and Rust and have it compiled down to WA. 
   2. LLVM - any LL language could compile to web assembly.
1. What are the best educational resources?
   1. Andreas’ books
   2. Ethereum wiki on Github
1. What was the hardest part about learning to develop with Ethereum?
   1. How to apply Ethereum tech and what makes sense.
1. Was anything easier than expected?
   1. Wallets UX has improved. 
1. Other bounties?
   1. Large players funding bug bounties for public smart contracts.
   2. Multisig is a pain in Ethereum. Multiparty signature with a single key from an account.
1. What are you most excited about in the short term?
   1. Lightning - cheap, fast micropayments even though it’s not out of beta.
   2. Ethereum bindings for lightning network?
   3. Cross-chain stuff in general.
1. Who are the other people you think we should talk to?
   1. Trail of Bits

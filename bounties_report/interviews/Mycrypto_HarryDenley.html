<li><strong>What type of apps do you build?</strong> <ol>

 <li>EAL: Ethereum Address Lookup to prevent phishing.
 <li>Back in June: chrome extension as a mini block explorer. Hover over any address, shows how many transactions it has etc.  <ol>

  <li>Couple weeks later, dedicated himself to finding phishing sites and black-listing them with Metamask and his chrome extension.
  <li>Recently – added service every midnight to do data gathering on each domain.   <ol>

   <li>There is a group working on anti-phishing. We share information and data through an established channel.
  <li>We now have a bot to run ops on domains (whois data gathering, DNS records, SSL dumps, Shodan data on the server)
  <li>We have also deployed an archive bot on Twitter @EthereumBadList 
 <li>His main effort: to protect users.
<li><strong>Try to remember the last time you developed a feature for ethereum and you ran into some unexpected obstacle. What was it? How did you feel?</strong> <ol>

 <li>I have mostly used Web3.js. It has a great wiki. I haven't had any real issues.  <ol>

  <li>Then: went to meetups where I heard of Truffle and Solidity. Documentation on setting up Testrpc and writing Solidity was not that great. Had trouble with Truffle documentation.    <ol>

    <li>Some dependencies for Truffle and the build they were using were missing.
 <li>Integrating Ethereum with browser hasn't been too troubling.  <ol>

  <li>Looks at Etherscan comments + MyCrypto support tickets comments.   <ol>

   <li>Anti-phishing – Etherscan blacklists bad addresses, through their moderation queue and etherscamdb.info reports.
  <li>Most people don't realize a Private Key should stay private
  <li>Airdrop sites require you to put in your private keys.
 <li>How to prevent phishing:  <ol>

  <li>Metamask added domain blacklisting + my extension.   <ol>

   <li>Spawned the idea of Cryptonite, run by Metacert: for Ethereum projects to verify if they're legit or not.
  <li>I plan to do analysis using PrestoDB, finding common outputs across Ethereum phishing addresses. E.g. If most addresses go through Shapeshift, then go through Monero, can then contact Shapeshift to add their blacklists.   <ol>

   <li>Big data requires a beefy server to run it on -- 
   <li>Open-source for big data analysis of chains for fraud. I talked with Chainalysis (they do Bitcoin analysis) about the idea    <ol>

    <li>I haven't wanted to do this – mainly because of cost & security. I'm looking into servers which could handle rate-limited requests.
    <li>Could put this towards the anti-phishing group.
    <li>Making the reports public would be simpler and already helpful
   <li>Allows me to run Mysql-style queries.
 <li>Lack of reliable faucet on testnets.
<li><strong>What was the first thing you built related to Ethereum, and when did you build it? </strong> <ol>

 <li>In the start of 2017, I got into Ethereum development.
 <li>Met team at Myetherwallet (now MyCrypto). Introduced me to other people like Griff.
<li><strong>Who are other people you think we should talk to?</strong> <ol>

 <li>Quiknode – selling managed Ethereum nodes that are in sync. Bit like Infura.  <ol>

  <li>Adam or Paxon.
<li><strong>Other bounties:</strong> <ol>

 <li>Building a platform / website to educate people on how to stay safe. MyCrypto has some stuff.  <ol>

  <li>I have a Twitter poll that described this idea.
  <li>Create a bounty around this.
<li><strong>What pisses you off:</strong> <ol>

 <li>People too focused on making money and not trying to evolve the society –– moons and lambos.
<li><strong>Misc</strong> <ol>

 <li>What I'm passionate about right now: helping people who are not technologists to not lose their money.  <ol>

  <li>Could make it harder for attackers to withdraw..
  <li>Talking to people from Changelly/etc re blacklisting addresses on exchanges.</li>  </ol>

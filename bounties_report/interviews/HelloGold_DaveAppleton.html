<li><strong>What type of apps do you build?</strong> <ol>

 <li>Lead blockchain dev @ HelloGold.
 <li>Token backed by gold.
 <li>Does consulting as well – writing smart contracts & backend for blockchain projects
<li><strong>Biggest problem/frustration?</strong> <ol>

 <li>About a year ago, it was ok running blockchain on your machine.
 <li>Switched from geth ropsten to Parity.
 <li>It's hard to run a Parity node now – the toll it takes on your machine.  <ol>

  <li>Both on mainnet and testnet.
 <li>You can't do serious stuff with Infura:  <ol>

  <li>e.g. getting events reliably
  <li>In Geth or Parity you can do some event filtering, but is tough to get right and maintain   <ol>

   <li>Infura limits the number of logging or block calls -> to limit server complexity or costs.
<li><strong>Debugger</strong> <ol>

 <li>Ethercamp  <ol>

  <li>Promote hackathons.
  <li>Ethereum Studio - what happened to it?   <ol>

   <li>Gave you break points in Solidity code (?!)    <ol>

    <li>You're running in a simulated VM. You're in your own dev environment.
   <li>Let you see all the state and local variables & methods
  <li>Came up with a node that EF took over and turned into EthereumJ
  <li>Ethercamp code is open-source -> Look into this…
 <li>I use Remix for prototyping something.
 <li>Will probably be a niche product.. Because not many developers are getting that low level
<li><strong>Best other tool:</strong>  <ol>

 <li>Parity: shows you events going to a contract.
<li><strong>Security or auditing:</strong> <ol>

 <li>Helps that I've been coding for a helluva long time.
 <li>The hardest thing for new devs is getting to contact the people they need.  <ol>

  <li>It's also hard to find non-expensive auditors.
 <li>Gitter community is the key
 <li>Best dev communities or Gitter channels:  <ol>

  <li>Go-ethereum
  <li>Solidity
  <li>Parity
 <li>I go to the specific one I need at the time.
<li><strong>Web3.js is another pain point:</strong> <ol>

 <li>Getting up to speed trying to do Web3.js is quite hard. There's a lot of conflicting information. The examples don't work. This is where you find that the node you're using doesn't support features ––
 <li>Go-ethereum wrapper: abigen  <ol>

  <li><strong>This is my favorite tool.</strong>
<li><strong>Programming languages</strong>: <ol>

 <li>Go:  <ol>

  <li>Compiled program with strong type checking, before the code even runs.
  <li>Enforces code standards, meaning your code is maintainable.   <ol>

   <li>The linter formats the code in a certain way. This makes it very easy to understand.
  <li>I choose readability over speed; Go over Rust.
<li><strong>Other developers to talk to:</strong> <ol>

 <li>Talk to Andreas to get to people in Singapore.
 <li>Rick Bale @ The team at Endorse.io  <ol>

  <li>Or also talk to the CTO.</li>  </ol>

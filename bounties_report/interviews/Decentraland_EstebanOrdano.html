<li><strong>What type of apps do you build:</strong> <ol>

 <li>Decentraland! I'm hiring two or three people – excellent engineers – to build tooling.    <ol>

   <li>We're calling the project Voltaire Labs, after the Voltaire house. Trying to get Sergio Lerner to help with that. Getting people I know from Google. Maybe we should join efforts? Will intro to Federico Bond.
  <li>Our infra:   <ol>

   <li>MANA token which is an ERC20.
   <li>Auction of Land.
   <li>Land smart contract which is an NFT token standard.    <ol>

    <li>Got tired of not hearing back re ERC non-fungibles improvements. Proposed alternative ERC.
    <li>Land registry of who owns which land parcel.
    <li>These link to IPFS or IPNS for content of land.
   <li>Decentralized exchange of land parcels.
   <li>Small tool for sending emails whenever an event is triggered on your contract. EthAlarm: takes address of contract, ABI, pick events that you're interested in.
  <li>We run the land auction off-chain, we had a period of registration where you'd send the MANA you wanted to use in the auction. At the end of the auction, we distributed the NFT tokens and returned MANA.   <ol>

   <li>Auction was mostly an independent application – better UX, less fees
  <li>Why the auction was off-chain:   <ol>

   <li>We processed around 115k bids. The UX for the auction was great. We managed to provide the user with an experience that was way better, because it wasn't blockchain-based.    <ol>

    <li>Both on the browser and the server, we exchanged cryptographic receipts –– "I'd like to bid for the following parcel (x,y), (x,y) – at the end you'd receive a signed receipt" – the server would receive that message, and say back "I've received a bid, and here's your receipt". All these receipts are public.     <ol>

     <li>Anyone in the auction everyone could act as an independent verifier of the auction.
    <li>We returned a receipt had a nonce –– 
    <li>We can audit the whole auction. Can prove every bid that we received.
   <li>How we've been running auditing –    <ol>

    <li>We sold $16m worth of parcels of land.
    <li>We wanted to make sure that they weren't messing up.
    <li>Not many people were checking – but a few did and even reported back some issues; community trusted them.
    <li>Would be best if this was run on a decentralized protocol so people didn't have to trust these guys.
  <li>We're building a voting scheme with MANA:   <ol>

   <li>"How tall should this building be?"
   <li>We are repeating the same pattern as the auction.
   <li>Our voting scheme is offchain and non-binding, because the project is early enough that people can back out.
 <li><strong>Try to remember the last time you developed a feature for ethereum and you ran into some unexpected obstacle. What was it? How did you feel?</strong>  <ol>

  <li>Pains:   <ol>

   <li>The gas issues – the expensiveness of the whole process.
   <li>We are subsidizing the whole process of deploying the land.    <ol>

    <li>We are also subsidizing the second transaction after the ERC is assigned.
   <li>This whole process will take 12 million, 150 ETH.
  <li>We also had to make the contract upgradable – with the delegate proxy pattern   <ol>

   <li>We are worried that Solidity will change, and the structure of storage will change.
   <li>Our thinking: we're doing some engineering on how to sell the next batch of land – we came up with a better system to sell that land – it's going to be pretty neat. We're not going to have this issue.
  <li>Decentralized exchanges:   <ol>

   <li>Looking forward to 0x adding a version of their protocol for non-fungibles. Which has now happened! <a href="https://blog.0xproject.com/introducing-0x-protocol-v2-9f5bda04d38d">https://blog.0xproject.com/introducing-0x-protocol-v2-9f5bda04d38d</a>
  <li>State channels:   <ol>

   <li>Looking forward for Raiden
   <li>Was thinking of funding Lightning Network for ERC20 network    <ol>

    <li>Simulating a UTXO model on ERC20 tokens
    <li>Wants for interoperability between Bitcoin and Ethereum.     <ol>

     <li>Olaoluwa (from Lightning) is the best coder in the world.
     <li>Bitcoin world is more secure.      <ol>

      <li>Lightning code is written like poetry.
<li><strong>Who are other people you think we should talk to?</strong> <ol>

 <li>Should speak with Fede –– should collaborate together –– they're interested in throwing money at sidechain & Plasma chain.
<li><strong>Other bounties:</strong> <ol>

 <li><span class="bounties">Biggest request: have ERC20 upgraded to ERC223:</span>  <ol>

  <li>We have troubles with small re-orgs – transferring immediately upon approvals causes issues.   <ol>

   <li>This was a problem with our code; hard to develop.
  <li>Have watchers on the Blockchain, and sending transaction to make correct transfer, e.g. for MANA token.</li>  </ol>

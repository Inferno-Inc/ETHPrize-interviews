<li><strong>What type of apps do you build?</strong> <ol>

 <li>I work at Consensys Diligence doing audits; similar to Zeppelin.
 <li>Also, I do technical communications / writing blog posts about best practices around security / Consensys docs / token repos.
<li><strong>Try to remember the last time you developed a feature for ethereum and you ran into some unexpected obstacle. What was it? How did you feel?</strong>  <ol>

  <li>Auditing:   <ol>

   <li>A lot of my time is spent understanding what the developer was trying to do. There's lots of back-and-forth and I want to maximize the probability that this is the only audit the company needs to do (end up doing a lot of free work this way & comms);     <ol>

    <li>I would like to see better standards in what the idea of "ready to launch" is / what docs should exist / what the depth of testing should be.
    <li>https://media.consensys.net/preparing-for-a-smart-contract-code-audit-83691200cb9c
   <li>I want to see:    <ol>

    <li>More efforts on gas optimization.     <ol>

     <li>Using Assembly to do things.
     <li>Use different languages.
   <li>One thing that kills me:    <ol>

    <li>When people copy-and-paste from Zeppelin or other libraries.     <ol>

     <li>As an auditor: do I run a git diff?
     <li>Large inheritances.
     <li>Ugly repos. Not tidy. Clean directory structure is key.      <ol>

      <li>These are real contracts.
      <li>These are testing contracts.
    <li>Wrote blog post so far.
   <li>What are most prevalent errors:    <ol>

    <li>People should use EPM to import / or Dapphub.
    <li>Add linting -> Solehint (?) / Solium.
   <li>What happens in a security audit:    <ol>

    <li>Run the tests. Usually because of different truffle or testrpc version.     <ol>

     <li>Have npm scripts to run local version of truffle.
    <li>The easier it is to read tests, the better.     <ol>

     <li>Self-referential tests.
    <li>Code coverage. Want all code to be run during testing; important code to be run multiple times.
    <li>Test the full specification.
    <li>Static analysis: we use a tool called Nifroll (?)     <ol>

     <li>Look at Solc warnings & analyze bytecode.
    <li>Reading the code is the most time-consuming part. Best opportunity to make us all more efficient: automated tools to help auditor pay attention to right parts.     <ol>

     <li>This is the most annoying part of the process.
     <li>Devs need to have written down their intentions for the code.      <ol>

      <li>Specification is evidence of thoughtfulness.
    <li>7) Use Oyente; but it doesn't find anything new generally.
   <li>We also think through game-theoretic attacks:    <ol>

    <li>E.g. front-running (transaction-ordering stuff).
   <li>What's ideal process for testing:    <ol>

    <li>1) run local testing
    <li>2) run that test suite on some testnet.
    <li>Put system on mainnet with 2 week bug bounty.     <ol>

     <li>E.g. ENS bugs weren't caught on testnet. There was a typo that didn't get caught.
    <li>Want: more scenarios were there's economic incentives to break the system – vs. just out of good will of devs spending time.
<li><strong>Brief walk through of the tools you use daily</strong> <ol>

 <li><strong>If not already mentioned, are there any libraries you rely on regularly?</strong>  <ol>

  <li>We use Truffle a lot (never had to use Dapple or Embark)
  <li>Zeppelin used by clients -- would like to use EPM more
  <li>Runs a Geth node myself 
  <li>Solhint linter 
  <li>Solidity Coverage is test measurement coverage tool
  <li>ETHGasReporter (Takes your Mocha reports and says how much Gas your test used.)   <ol>

   <li>Would like to see a fuzz tester.
   <li>Excited to learn more formal verification + bringing into practice – intro to Sergio?
<li><strong>Who are other people you think we should talk to?</strong> <ol>

 <li>Piper Merriam
 <li>Nick Johnson
 <li>Christian Lundkvist (@ Consensys)
 <li>Joseph Chow (@ Consensys)
 <li>Mike Golden (@ Consensys)
<li><strong>What pisses you off?</strong> <ol>

 <li>Documentation around best practices external to writing smart contracts  <ol>

  <li>E.g. how to safely deploy your system.   <ol>

   <li>There's easy tricks how to make this easier..
   <li>There's lots of operational & security related info to share..
   <li>Bounty this into one doc as resource list.</li>   </ol>

<h2>Peter Czaban</h2>

<ol>

<li><strong>What type of apps do you build:</strong> <ol>

 <li>Been working on the core Parity client on the consensus algorithms. Consensus contracts in solidity. Proof of stake.
<li><strong>How do you test things which interact with the blockchain? </strong> <ol>

 <li>Mostly truffle for testing. Also have some of my own custom tooling that works on RPC.
<li><strong>Brief walk through of the tools you use daily</strong> <ol>

 <li>Truffle, solidity syntax highlighter for VIM, Jupiter notebook for testing stuff
 <li><strong>If not already mentioned, are there any libraries you rely on regularly?</strong>  <ol>

  <li>EtherJS 
  <li>In Rust similar libraries like @crypto and @key
<li><strong>What isn't possible with current tools, but would be nice</strong> <ol>

 <li>Being able to run things in exactly the same environment as the deployment environment (for me, it was necessary to have a custom client that I ran code against)  <ol>

  <li>Parity / Truffle sometimes behave in different ways
  <li>Built a custom thing that had partial functionality to give a more consistent testing environment
 <li>Being able to track versioning of contracts from dev to deployment. Requires a lot of back and forth.
 <li>Pain points working with the language. <span class="bounties">I want a better type system!</span>
<li><strong>What is most frustrating about developing on ETH?</strong> <ol>

 <li>Definitely the language and tooling. Testing frameworks.  <ol>

  <li>Truffle can be weird and does some asynchronous things that cause tests to randomly fail.
  <li>Linking contracts together is still kind of bad.
 <li><strong>Are you running into problems with any of the following:</strong>  <ol>

  <li><strong>Gas limit: </strong>Peter: 
  <li><strong>Off-chain computation: </strong>Yeah, this can be somewhat difficult. I have seen others not being able to use it, so it clearly needs to be easier. 
  <li>Could detect patterns in a contract and recommend that something could be done off-chain.   <ol>

   <li>Sometimes you want to have privacy. Solidity and compiler could figure out for you how to make particular mappings anonymous.
  <li><strong>State Channels: </strong>Played around with a simple one but no serious problems or anything.
<li><strong>What process do you use for validating the security of your smart contracts?</strong> <ol>

 <li>First contracts were usually for prototypes.  <ol>

  <li>I would write contract, write tests, then integration tests.
  <li>Then would go through a review process.
  <li>Sometimes would go to an external audit.   <ol>

   <li>This only happened for a few projects.
<li><strong>What was the hardest part about learning to develop with Ethereum?</strong> <ol>

 <li>For building the client, it was high-level architecture, but that was resolved just by having lots of conversations with people.
 <li>For building with Ethereum, it was Javascript and Truffle, because I already had good understanding of Ethereum at that point.
<li><strong>What was the first thing you built related to Ethereum, and when did you build it?</strong> <ol>

 <li>Some trading algorithm.
 <li>During the early foundation days, there were workshops in London, and during one of those workshops I was writing a dapp using Mist.
 <li>Then, later, I deployed a token contract for fun, and then basically started straight away with client development.
<li><strong>What applications are you most excited about in the near term (ie. what do you think will be working soon)</strong> <ol>

 <li>From experimental projects, I am interested in prediction markets and how they will work and how good the price discovery is.
 <li>A very good application is something that doesn't require too much throughput. Something around supply chains could be really interesting. Many parties, don't necessarily trust each other.
<li><strong>Who are other people you think we should talk to (alternative:  Who is the best developer you know)</strong> <ol>

 <li>Parity guys that work on the UI.</li> </ol>

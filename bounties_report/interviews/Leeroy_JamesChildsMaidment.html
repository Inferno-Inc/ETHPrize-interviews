<h2>James Childs-Maidment</h2>

<ol>

<li><strong>What type of apps do you build:</strong> <ol>

 <li>Been building social apps on Ethereum. Leeroy.
 <li>Storing all posts and likes on-chain, syncing that with a centralized database and frontend.
<li><strong>How do you test things which interact with the blockchain: </strong> <ol>

 <li>Truffle for testing (JS unit tests).  <ol>

  <li>I really enjoying writing async await tests with Truffle.
 <li><strong>Automated testing? And how do you facilitate manual testing?</strong>  <ol>

  <li>I play with the contracts in Remix. Deploy the contracts to testrpc and then test manually using the UI.
<li><strong>Brief walk through of the tools you use daily</strong> <ol>

 <li>React / Redux app, with a firebase backend
 <li>Truffle. Just deployed using Remix, and uses it for playing with the contracts in general.
 <li><strong>If not already mentioned, are there any libraries you rely on regularly?</strong>  <ol>

  <li>Web3JS
 <li>In a toy project, I used MetaMask just for signing transactions. Had a separate web3 using Infura for other stuff.
<li><strong>What isn't possible with current tools, but would be nice</strong> <ol>

 <li>When you use Web3 library with Metamask, it's really crappy getting events coming through.  <ol>

  <li>Maybe will get fixed when moving to websockets with 1.0
<li><strong>What is most frustrating about developing on ETH? (Specifically - talk about UI issues / scaling)</strong> <ol>

 <li>The tools are pretty early. Constantly running into a ton of bugs.  <ol>

  <li>On Leeroy, had to install packages and fix stuff from other projects that were broken so he could use them.
  <li>Yesterday was playing around with a new app, and was using Ganache, and it would just lock up and crash. Then you need to redeploy the local smart contracts, which takes about a minute to get up and running again.
 <li>A really stable local chain would be cool.
 <li>With solidity, it would be great if you could get a better view of what went wrong when a transaction fails.
<li><strong>What process do you use for validating the security of your smart contracts?</strong> <ol>

 <li>No process, but would love to have it.
 <li>Apart from testing, would be cool to have tools that analyze what you've written and make sure you're not doing anything dumb.
 <li>Right now, using Remix is helpful for getting warnings and stuff.
 <li>Hasn't used Oyente
<li><strong>What was the hardest part about learning to develop with Ethereum</strong> <ol>

 <li>Only started in June or so.
 <li>Just reading through github and reddit instead of an actual source for education. Having really good docs in one place is a big thing.
<li><strong>What was the first thing you built related to Ethereum, and when did you build it? (NEW)</strong> <ol>

 <li>Probably some little smart contract that saved a string to variable.
 <li>After that, just dove in on making Leroy over the next few months.  <ol>

  <li>After getting a feel for solidity by playing with Remix.
  <li>Didn't really understand how expensive it would be to save everything on the blockchain. Solution was to store the hash of all the inputs.
  <li>From there, had to learn how to make things as cheap as possible.
 <li>Quite a bit of smart contract work on Leroy. Multiple versions of the contract along the way.
 <li>Because it's as cheap as possible, Leroy doesn't even fire events.
<li><strong>What applications are you most excited about in the near term (ie. what do you think will be working soon)</strong> <ol>

 <li>Aragon.</li> </ol>

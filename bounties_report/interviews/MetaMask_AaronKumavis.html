<li><strong>What's your view of bounties in general?</strong> <ol>

 <li>We've had good experience with bounties – Gitcoin,
 <li>One issue: bounties denominated in ETH or tokens, which leaves them open to volatility and potentially unhappy contributors.
 <li>Gitcoin, has ERC20 support, so you can use DAI now, which should help significantly.
 <li>People sometimes do crappy jobs, then get angry that they're bounty wasn't accepted. This is, in a general, a problem between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation which still needs to be solved.
 <li>Internally requirements change sometimes, leading us to not wanting to accept the solution even it abides by the initial spec, because we'd need to do a refactor around it.
<li><strong>On the call:</strong> <ol>

 <li>Whymarrh: contracting in the space, working on Metamask UI, working at Kyokan.
 <li>Kumavis.
<li><strong>What are you working on?</strong> <ol>

 <li>Metamask –   <ol>

  <li>wallet functionality; 
  <li>not losing your private keys; 
  <li>showing you what you're signing, and what the side-effects of that are; 
  <li>choosing a good gas price
 <li>Using Ethereum.js, Eth.js.
 <li>One thing we don't do well – conveying on-chain errors that happen during tx execution.  <ol>

  <li>Want to be able to go deeper.   <ol>

   <li>Source map tooling. Here's where it exactly went wrong.
 <li><span class="bounties">Want: an API to get source maps for published contracts.</span>
 <li>Source mapping tool already exists.  <ol>

  <li>Give it the trace information. They can generate this themselves using the json rpc.
  <li>Find where it reverted.
  <li>Throw that into the source maps.
  <li>That'll give you the original line it was on.
 <li>Could do more fancy analysis: find what values in the state are.
 <li>Not sure how useful this would be the average user.
<li><strong>Usability?</strong> <ol>

 <li>Challenging because there's a large range of users.  <ol>

  <li>E.g. Kenny at MakerDao who's now at RChain. Hiss job was to manage the multisig for their funds. He's sent a 1000 transactions on Metamask, he's always signing, approving, etc.
  <li>E.g. other people have no idea what's going on, want to participate in an ICO. Any extra information you give them confuses them.
 <li>Toyed around with the idea of presenting two different ideas. Advanced mode.
 <li>We have a whole support team.
 <li>Some tickets are sophisticated bug reports. Some are "hey, you stole my money".
 <li>We're trying to build general education resources.
 <li><span class="bounties">Bounty: Ethereum for dummies.</span>  <ol>

  <li>In Metamask support –   <ol>

   <li>What is a private key, what is a seed phrase (most important!)
   <li>Tokens are initially straightforward. But looking at a block explorer, it says my tx was sent somewhere else.
   <li>Why do I need to pay ETH to send a token to someone?
   <li>Gas prices.
 <li>Metamask can share learnings from their support team.
 <li>Whymarrh is introduced in contributing few hours.  <ol>

  <li>Thinks videos or walk-through could be the best medium for explaining complex things.
 <li>Kauri can have specific documentation for technical stuff.
<li><strong>What are the biggest problems with transaction confirmation?</strong> <ol>

 <li>We need to explain what is happening to our users. The DApp could be lying about what's happening, which makes it extra complicated/interesting.
 <li>Metamask receives a tx from the DApp, but no more info.  <ol>

  <li>How do you convert that into a message to the user?
  <li>"It looks like its talking to a token contract; or sending a random blob of data..."
 <li>Take that low-level data and have to convey to the user what's happening.
 <li>We have special cases – e.g. a token transfer, this is an ERC721, this is a DAO proposal, etc.
 <li>There's non-normal stuff – e.g. what's it like for a sidechain?
 <li>Multi-network –– how would it work for non-Ethereum stuff?  <ol>

  <li>E.g. secure scuttlebutt.
  <li>E.g. Filecoin, Dfinity, etc.
  <li>E.g. Plasma chains inside of Ethereum.
 <li>Standardization of transactions, blocks, signatures, etc.  –– not bounty-able right now. Need to build an architecture around it.  <ol>

  <li>Then, you need plugins, which could be a good fit bounties.
<li><strong>What about scaling? You have 1m users...</strong> <ol>

 <li>A lot of the work for scaling has happened inside of Infura.  <ol>

  <li>Part of it is just throwing money on the fire.
 <li>They developed a REST api for json rpc. So now they can put a CDN in front of it, and get caching.  <ol>

  <li>But now, a standard provider can't point at the REST interface.
 <li>Seems like the big need is for standardization.  <ol>

  <li>E.g. Maker's ERC20 version doesn't match the standard.
 <li>That's not because we don't have enough conversation, it's that we don't have real governance.
 <li>Infura is an existential risk for Metamask, because it's expensive and we're a non-profit.  <ol>

  <li>We've been working for a while on our light-client. We're blocked by some libp2p internals.</li>  </ol>

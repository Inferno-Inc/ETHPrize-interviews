<ol>

<li><strong>What type of apps do you build?</strong> <ol>

 <li>I have built 1Protocol
 <li>It lets smart contracts sign up as miners on different proof of stake protocols  <ol>

  <li>Let users provide the contract with the stake
  <li>It's like a mining pool, but for staking
 <li>Three things  <ol>

  <li>Interface for signing signatures (like MEW) and sending tokens to mediators
  <li>Building actual contracts that accept tokens and are signed up in Raiden as a mediator
  <li>Actually running the mediating machine on Raiden.   <ol>

   <li>Eventually, anyone can send tokens and anyone can run the machine
   <li>For this, simply writing software around the Raiden node client. Raiden has published a python client. When you run it, it exposes an API on your computer, and 1Protocol is writing software that interacts with that API.
<li><strong>How do you test things which interact with the blockchain?</strong> <ol>

 <li>Truffle suite. Before that, built our own unit testing system.
<li><strong>Brief walk through of the tools you use daily</strong> <ol>

 <li><strong>If not already mentioned, are there any libraries you rely on regularly?</strong>  <ol>

  <li>Just web3JS and the python raiden client
<li><strong>What isn't possible with current tools, but would be nice</strong> <ol>

 <li>There is no tooling or anything related to state channels that is trusted yet.
 <li>Need the MEW of state channels.
<li><strong>Try to remember the last time you developed a feature for ethereum and you ran into some unexpected obstacle. What was it? How did you feel?</strong>  <ol>

  <li>Needing to resolve problems like how to setup web3, talk to contracts, remote vs constant transactions. Lots of re-implementing solutions.
<li><strong>What surprised you on the other end, what was way easier than expected?</strong> <ol>

 <li>Writing smart contracts is surprisingly neat. Not actually as hard as it seems. You can have a mental model of all the moving pieces in your head, which is actually harder with other kinds of software.
<li><strong>What process do you use for validating the security of your smart contracts?</strong> <ol>

 <li>Human thinking and auditing.
 <li>Will find some external team to do a professional audit.
<li><strong>What was the hardest part about learning to develop with Ethereum</strong> <ol>

 <li>Solidity is changing so quickly that, as an example,   <ol>

  <li>changes to visibility modifiers (public / private etc.) has gone through a view iterations.
  <li>It would be great if there was a resource that combined solidity read the docs with the github releases
<li><strong>What applications are you most excited about in the near term (ie. what do you think will be working soon)</strong> <ol>

 <li>Raiden is the golden egg in the space. The experience of actually using Ethereum will improve a ton.
 <li>"Counterfactual" team building some general purpose state channels.
 <li>Less bullish on actual applications on Ethereum right now.
<li><strong>Which bounty would you want someone to solve?</strong> <ol>

 <li>Breaking out a javascript library for web pages that are accepting payments, which allows you to accept any kind of wallet mechanisms: Ledger, Metamask, Priv key, encrypted keystore, etc.
 <li>Same thing needs to exist for desktop software. Need a simple desktop wallet that accepts any kind of access to payments.</li> </ol>

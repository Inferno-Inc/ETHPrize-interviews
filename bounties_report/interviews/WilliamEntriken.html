<li><strong>What type of apps do you build?</strong> <ol>

 <li>Started using Ethereum in December.
 <li>Created ERC721/161 to support my project. It was contentious, I won the fork wars.  <ol>

  <li>Underestimated how crazy this ERC721 process was.
  <li>721 is the first standard that's actually an Interface.
  <li>Interfaces are broken in Solidity.
 <li>Started filling bugs in Solidity. –– interfaces should be able to inherit from interfaces.  <ol>

  <li>External vs public in interfaces. I fixed it.
  <li>Fixing things in Solidity –– basically rewriting the whole inheritance model in Solidity.
 <li>In 721, I had a caveat section, "errors in Solidity etc" ––  <ol>

  <li>People said: "the standard shouldn't say a function is payable" –– but I said that the interface needs to enforce this.
 <li>Got the attention of Christian, Alex, Hudson.
 <li>721 had a dependency on 165. So I started to fix 165.
 <li>Mainly occupied with full time job, speaking re: 721 and its use cases at conferences, evangelism, million dollar homepage, navy, google, hardware (semiconductors)
 <li>Big open-source guy, worked on KDE project, worked in semiconductors.
<li><strong>The #1 problem:</strong>  <ol>

 <li>My mom wants to buy ETH. In order to do this, she has to go to Gemini, give her SIN, give access to webcam, and access to their bank account.
 <li>Biggest bank in this ecosystem is Coinbase.
 <li>Every ICO is "illegal"
 <li>Need a new crypto bank. This bank needs to solve two huge problems:  <ol>

  <li>Identity management (provided by the bank themself).
  <li>Anti money laundering
<li><strong>The #2 problem:</strong>  <ol>

 <li>Solving KYC / AML for the general population, is understandable, and secure  <ol>

  <li>Couple solutions like <$300 transactions lets you avoid AML restrictions
<li><strong>Other problems?</strong> <ol>

 <li>Lack of private/business incentive to solve Bank/payments, not exchange, problem in crypto
 <li>The ERC process:  <ol>

  <li>Bring initiative, there's forks, solve the problems –– being polite, being political, making phone calls to reach consensus.
  <li>Problems:   <ol>

   <li>Problem #1: Ethereum is centralized. Code / governance is handled by one party.    <ol>

    <li>This is the "EIP" process.
    <li>These aren't technical reasons, they're political reasons.
  <li>The EIP process:   <ol>

   <li>Anybody writes an EIP – must be technically valid, describes a change to the Ethereum ecosystem. "I want a sidechain", "i want to change the gas for this opcode", etc
   <li>If the EIP is implementable (i.e. it compiles), it's accepted as a draft.
   <li>If there is community support, it'll be reviewed by all core devs.
   <li>If it is supported by core devs, it is implemented.
   <li>If people support it, then people will upgrade the clients.
  <li>How it actually works:   <ol>

   <li>You publish the EIP. There is a storm of discussion; emotional, backhanded.    <ol>

    <li>Blackballed for mentioning cultural/political taboos
   <li>PR is not the right word for it. More like a wiki.
   <li>They discuss it at the core dev meeting. They implement the code, clients upgrade it.    <ol>

    <li>Someone puts it on Hudson's PM meeting agenda
  <li>How Swift (from Apple) handles this:   <ol>

   <li>You go to the mailing lists, you start a discussion. 
   <li>This takes a lot of effort, so you wanna be sure your stuff is legit. 
   <li>Big discussion in the community. Swift is centralized (one party). You need code already, a test case or something, you explain technically in-depth. You get it to review, 2 week review period, it's posted on top of Apple Swift website + goes out to mailing list.
   <li>The key point is: the 2 week speed pump. Everyone has to pass through that.
  <li>How DARPA handles bounties   <ol>

   <li>Here's a very specific problem and you need a 100x improvement
   <li>Come up with working solution that can support network of 10k
   <li>If you can do it elegantly, here's 50k and we'll study it further before implementing
 <li>The community expects full-time people; they don't cater to part-time contributors.  <ol>

  <li>A contributor needs to look at all issues and PRs –– there's no queueing system. One could get approved at any time.
 <li>The ERC process:  <ol>

  <li>Write an interface for a contract. He wrote 165 and 721.
  <li>A ton of new token standards.
  <li>First mover advantage to writing standards/interfaces - something like street cred for devs. 
  <li>Over-standardization occuring
  <li>Not enough focus on what people would actually want/need to use
 <li>Doesn't see need for package manager, existing tools adequate.
 <li>Not enough money allocation from teams to bug bounties.

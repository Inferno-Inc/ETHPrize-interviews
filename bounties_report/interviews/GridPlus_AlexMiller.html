<li><strong>What type of apps do you build?</strong> <ol>

 <li>Started ETH development back in 2015. Shortly after launch; there was nothing. I remember booting up private chains from shell scripts. We've come a long way in terms of dev tools. Problem isn't that there aren't tools, but not knowing where to look.
 <li>The problem here is sourcing a centralized repository for information.  <ol>

  <li>EF website doesn't do that.
  <li>Wouldn't know where to point people from intro documentation.
  <li>Truffle & Solidity have good docs e.g.
 <li>Biggest pain points: a place where all these tools get published that isn't just Github.
<li><strong>Is the solution to hire / pay people to manage a wiki?</strong> <ol>

 <li><span class="bounties">Maybe a better solution would be to fork NpmJS.com, source that data, curate that list for Ethereum dev tools</span>  <ol>

  <li>Would check that deployment to node packages happened & EthereumPM setup correctly.
  <li>Can see how many people have downloaded. It's a good method of discovery.
  <li>Could have different subsections e.g. Merkle tools, hashing tools, ABI encoders.   <ol>

   <li>I use Ethereumjs-util – but I know there are others.
 <li>What about EthPM?  <ol>

  <li>It's only on Ropsten. What is the link between EthPM and the actual blockchain? I like that there is an actual package manager. Good thing is that you can install packages with Truffle. 
  <li>I don't get where the data is stored –– is it on IPFS? Is it linked to Ropsten? Why?!
  <li>Still, it's great. But recently it stopped working.
  <li>I wanted to deploy a trustless-relay – but had issues.
 <li>Could make one of these Awesome-Ethereum Github repos?
 <li>Also knowing what you need to discover is important: wiki would help here.
<li><strong>Other frustrations?</strong> <ol>

 <li>Truffle  <ol>

  <li>The fact that you don't really get errors, or more specifically stack traces. Whenever you run into an error, it gives you a line number.   <ol>

   <li>In JS files.
 <li>How to match up hashes of data with what you get in Solidity.  <ol>

  <li>e.g. When you're tightly packing arguments, they need to be left-padded to 32 bytes. But not always, e.g. different for addresses and numbers.
 <li><span class="bounties">A little app like this for Solidity would be amazing, which gives you all the Solidity hashes:</span> <a href="https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/md4.html">https://emn178.github.io/online-tools/md4.html</a>    <ol>

    <li>Emulate what's happening in Solidity in the browser.
<li><strong>More tools you like using?</strong> <ol>

 <li>Configure parity instance –– <a href="https://github.com/GridPlus/trustless-relay/blob/master/parity/boot.js">https://github.com/GridPlus/trustless-relay/blob/master/parity/boot.js</a>  <ol>

  <li>Infrastructure tool to spin up local instances of Parity or Geth
 <li>Testing:  <ol>

  <li>Use Mocha; plain old truffle tests.
  <li>I don't do contract unit tests.
 <li>Security testing of code?  <ol>

  <li>Hasn't had any novel code that needed security audits before
  <li>There are common patterns that could be detected. E.g. reentrancy attacks, etc
 <li>Any other bounties specifically:  <ol>

  <li>Collecting logs & events used to be hard. Web3 1.0 made this a lot easier. It is quite good, even-though it's in beta.
  <li>People should be using websocket calls more. Maybe more education around this. Serious efficiency gains to be had here.
 <li>Who else should we talk to:  <ol>

  <li>Sean Pollock.
  <li>Mark Beylin.
  <li>Goncalo (from Consensys audit). He has a great library for dealing with bytes (byteslib).</li>  </ol>

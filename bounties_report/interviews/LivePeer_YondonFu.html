<li><strong>What type of apps do you build?</strong> <ol>

 <li>Previously: working on smart contracts.  <ol>

  <li>Truffle, testrpc / ganache-cli.
  <li>Expanded our test suite so they could run on multiple clients: could point at testrpc, at geth or Parity on PoA mode.
 <li>Now: Golang for our node.  <ol>

  <li>Integrating our smart contracts with their node that does video-processing.
  <li>Working with Geth. There's packages for interacting with EVM.
<li><strong>Try to remember the last time you developed a feature for ethereum and you ran into some unexpected obstacle. What was it? How did you feel?</strong> <ol>

 <li>Smart contracts:  <ol>

  <li>Contract compilation time is slow. We use Truffle compilation, which I thinks uses Javascript-bindings for C++ compiler.    <ol>

   <li>Sometimes the compilation takes longer than the tests.
   <li>Running C++ compiler (solc) without the Javascript binding is way faster.    <ol>

    <li>Can Truffle use the Solidity compiler internally, without the JS binding?
    <li>Maybe this is an easy feature add.
   <li>I've played with DappHub. It's much faster.
  <li>It would also be helpful to specify a compiler version to use without using a completely different version of Truffle
  <li>If you make a change, Truffle tries to be smart about which contracts to recompile. Sometimes this doesn't work and you need to blow away /build dir and recompile. Not a great UX.
  <li>In 'truffle console': using JS promises are annoying –– can be verbose and hard to read.   <ol>

   <li>Would be cool: having a transformation of that console, if it had async/await, or some kind of wrapper to make things seem synchronous.
  <li>If I see an error in a contract:   <ol>

   <li>Debugging sucks. Right now: comment out code, recompile, deploy, run again.    <ol>

    <li>Solidity is adding a "reason" string for the revert message. So you can have reasoning!
  <li>They have an internal Ethereum testnet running.
 <li>Writing the Go client:  <ol>

  <li>Pain point: nonce management –   <ol>

   <li>Options:    <ol>

    <li>Geth web3.sendTransaction: geth sets the nonce for you.
    <li>The other option is to pick the nonce yourself.
   <li>For our client, we do the nonce management ourselves: there's a method to get the Nonce, and includes transactions in "pending" state, but you don't know them if you're not a miner.    <ol>

    <li>This is an issue if you submit concurrent transactions.
    <li>Parity has a custom method called nextNonce, which works properly – 
  <li>Parity vs. Geth different methods – there's more room for cross-client feature sharing, adding things into the standard RPC interface.
<li><strong>Who are other people you think we should talk to?</strong> <ol>

 <li>Guys at Aragon – Jorge or Oliver.  <ol>

  <li>Ethereum Natural Specification style – basically a commenting style that can have auto-generated comments from it. Aragon is building a <a href="https://github.com/aragon/radspec">custom version</a> of this.
 <li>Zeppelin.
 <li>0x  <ol>

  <li>Been putting out good developer tooling. Really into Typescript, static typing.
<li><strong>What pisses you off:</strong> <ol>

 <li>Livepeer that runs as Daemon, unlock your wallet, give this an in-memory key. They have a DPoS protocol built-in.  <ol>

  <li>Similar operational problems as someone running a validator node for Casper FFG
  <li>How does Daemon have access to private key, in non-manual confirmation from you? How do you do this securely?
  <li>What's the proper key management flow. Not necessarily a bounty, but shared knowledge.
 <li>Need better documentation  <ol>

  <li>Some of the new things you need to use are not documented yet. Writing documentation is a good way to introduce someone to internals of a project (they need to understand stuff to write the docs).   <ol>

   <li>Example: heard this from Eric at Livepeer, there's a tool in Geth called Pupeth: uses Docker containers to set up an Ethereum private network, gives you dashboard - would be awesome.
   <li><span class="bounties">libp2p (networking layer for IPFS) especially since it's gaining a lot of adoption but the examples for getting started are still a little sparse.</span>
<li><strong>Misc:</strong> <ol>

 <li>Have we considered Grants, for longer-term things, vs. simply bounties?  <ol>

  <li>E.g. Debugger would require longer-term maintenance, needs to develop in pace with Ethereum development. One-time bounty might not be enough.
  <li>Might be a fit for longer-term projects. Milestone-based?
 <li>Nicola Greco had some interesting <a href="https://nicola.io/research-coin/2017">ideas</a> about incentivizing more open, collaborative academic research - are there learnings from thinking in this design space that can be applied to general open source?</li> </ol>

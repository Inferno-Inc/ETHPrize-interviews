<ol>

<li><strong>What type of apps do you build? </strong> <ol>

 <li>Rich user facing Dapps using a modern JS web tech stack. 
 <li>Solidity for writing smart contracts and web3 for the connection to the blockchain. 
 <li>Next thing I'm working on: solidity, truffle, javascript, ipfs.
<li><strong>How do you test things which interact with the blockchain: </strong> <ol>

 <li>At first, getting contract working use Remix or testing framework built into truffle. 
 <li>I don't use Ganache. 
 <li>I really like connecting my contracts a real instance, and I like using console to connect to node.
 <li>I do it in layers. First start developing against testrpc because its faster. Then use geth.
<li><strong>Could you give me a walk through of the tools you use daily? </strong> <ol>

 <li>I use python for numeric analytics (not really around dapps). 
 <li>For desktop apps I'll use Electron. 
 <li>For contract development I use solidity, and web3.js for a connection to the blockchain. 
 <li>Zeppelin's libraries for solidity. 
 <li>0x has excellent repo for js.
<li><strong>What isn't possible with current tools, but would be nice? </strong> <ol>

 <li>Logging within solidity is hard, you can emit an event. 
 <li>Tools around gas are hard, its so opaque. 
 <li>Remix and gas is maddening, different gas limits, might have contract call that works in one env that doesn't work in another.
 <li>Formal verification; we need something better than solidity. Bamboo seems cool.
 <li>interested in the successor to serpent - vyper.
<li><strong>What is most frustrating about developing on ETH? </strong> <ol>

 <li>Everything seems super easy getting started, especially once you understand how the blockchain works. 
 <li>Then you learn about security vulnerabilities like re-entrancy, other well known hacks, etc. Developers don't think about that when doing web dev.
 <li>Newline's third class is "Hack smart contracts", and it covers DAO hack. The goal is to teach folks about security.
<li><strong>What process do you use for validating the security of your smart contracts? </strong> <ol>

 <li>Wish i knew better how to do audits. Would love to know list of auditors. However, even if I could get in touch with auditors it sounds expensive.
 <li>Use solc linter when developing. 
<li><strong>What was the hardest part about learning to develop with Ethereum? </strong> <ol>

 <li>Tutorials are out of date. 
 <li>API totally changed in web3 beta. 
 <li>Understanding the Ethereum blockchain & program execution model. 
 <li>What it means to "call" and get (for free) or "send" and updating the blockchain for a fee. What it means for you transaction to be mined. This is covered in newline. 
 <li>If high performance computing today is extremely parallel, then blockchain computing is embarrassingly serial.
<li><strong>What was the first thing you built related to Ethereum, and when did you build it? </strong> <ol>

 <li>Creating my own token using the tutorial on<a href="http://Ethereum.org"> Ethereum.org</a>. 
 <li>Some of the other tutorials on the<a href="http://Ethereum.org"> Ethereum.org</a> page.
<li><strong>Who are other people you think we should talk to?</strong> <ol>

 <li>Interesting smart contract platforms coming out. 
 <li>LISK dapps in eos web assembly.

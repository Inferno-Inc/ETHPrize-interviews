<h2>Manuel Araoz</h2>

<ol>

<li><strong>What type of apps do you build?</strong> <ol>

 <li>Open Zeppelin: open source smart contract framework
 <li>Currently working on building web app  <ol>

  <li>On chain libraries with upgradability
  <li>Contract interaction
  <li>Marketplace
  <li>Scheduler for asynchronous execution.
<li><strong>How do you test things which interact with the blockchain? </strong> <ol>

 <li>Truffle automated testing with javascript unit tests
 <li>Migrated to async/await style of tests
 <li>Mocha, Chai
 <li>Onchain bug bounties for finding implementation bugs.
<li><strong>Brief walk through of the tools you use daily?</strong> <ol>

 <li>Use the truffle toolkit the entire way. Truffle for testing.
 <li>Publish on npm for users to use open zeppelin.
 <li>One of the first to try ethpm.  <ol>

  <li>It was super buggy with IPFS errors and it couldn't find the resources and stuff
<li><strong>What isn't possible with current tools, but would be nice</strong> <ol>

 <li>Upgradability
 <li>We're going to build an upgradable library, for the most used kinds of contracts. So that you can just use the library and it will be an upgradable form.  <ol>

  <li>Upgradability requires governance mechanisms though, and these are more difficult to figure out, as it is not just about code.
 <li>We are not working on debugging, but would love to see someone solve it  <ol>

  <li>We use the truffle debugger but it's not covering all their needs
  <li>Remix is good, but we would rather not use the web UI.
 <li>Better tools for deploying and managing contracts on the blockchain  <ol>

  <li>We're building this (John & Marcus)
 <li>Tools to replay past transactions  <ol>

  <li>E.g. for historical testing of upgrades.. replaying transactions from previous versions and making sure they don't break.
 <li>Stress-testing cryptoeconomic system: we only really do human analysis now. 
 <li>Better tools – like simulations of the mechanism design to prevent game theoretic problems – would be cool. This can be a bounty.
<li><strong>What process do you use for validating the security of your smart contracts?</strong> <ol>

 <li>We design first then develop. 
 <li>Sometimes they see other teams mix these two phases.  <ol>

  <li>This is bad, because you can break your assumptions in nuanced ways..
<li><strong>Who are other people you think we should talk to?</strong> <ol>

 <li>Jorge from Aragon.
 <li>Kevin Owocki from Gitcoin.
 <li>Other Zeppelin devs: he will make intro.
 <li>Esteban from Decentraland.
<li><strong>Other notes:</strong> <ol>

 <li>Interesting: Solidity compiler team runs OpenZeppelin tests when they update & other projects tests to make sure they're not breaking.</li> </ol>

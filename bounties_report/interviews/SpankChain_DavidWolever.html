<h2>David Wolever</h2>

<ol>

<li><strong>What type of apps do you build:</strong> <ol>

 <li>Been working with Spankchain team. Combination of state channels and smart contracts.
 <li>Also worked on smart contract for ICO auction.
<li><strong>How do you test things which interact with the blockchain: </strong> <ol>

 <li>First, use Truffle for unit testing.
 <li>Series of scripts for blockchain scraping. Call Truffle to send transactions to testrpc. Script connects to testrpc to make sure the state has been correctly changed.
 <li>Manual testing by running multiple test auctions. Just actually going through the process 40 or 50 times over the course of a week. Started on testrpc and then did it on a testnet with more test users. Even tested on the mainnet a few days before the real auction.  <ol>

  <li>Tests on the mainnet actually revealed new problems that weren't revealed on testnet
  <li>Because there were hundreds of logs per block on the mainnet, it was too many
  <li>Had to go through and make performance better on mainnet
<li><strong>Brief walk through of the tools you use daily</strong> <ol>

 <li>Vim editor, truffle. Metamask. 
 <li>Switching over to onenet, using something called Vinos. Under the radar.
 <li>Vinos going to support state channels natively. Will be a little bit less terrible than Metamask.
 <li>Trouble with metamask.  <ol>

  <li>Interface not well documented.
  <li>Doesn't have promises.
  <li>Had awful error reporting.
  <li>Don't know when someone closes metamask transaction. Had to write logic that says if they've clicked the button 3 times and we haven't heard back, give them a tooltip. No documentation for that kind of thing.
 <li>Vinos will be iframed, not chrome extension.
<li><strong>What isn't possible with current tools, but would be nice</strong> <ol>

 <li>Need a tool like metamask supporting state channels (Vinos will fix this)
 <li>So hard to get insights into what's going on in solidity.  <ol>

  <li>Debuggers are really hard to use.
  <li>Debugging tests is a matter of just guessing why assertions failed.
 <li>Solidity interpreter would be awesome without having to compile each time, would make development much faster.
<li><strong>What is most frustrating about developing on ETH? </strong>  <ol>

  <li><strong>Gas limit: </strong>No problems with this really.   <ol>

   <li>Metamask was giving absurd gas prices because another service was getting it wrong.
  <li><strong>State Channels: </strong>Have had a pretty good experience there. Biggest time sync is blockchain to database synchronization. David wrote something for using state channels with SQL. Insert transactions from a block, insert signed messages, and get balance for account.    <ol>

   <li>Biggest frustration is getting block messages into the database. 
   <li>Wrote a tool called Chainsaw that does this. No mechanism for a reorg.
<li><strong>What process do you use for validating the security of your smart contracts?</strong> <ol>

 <li>Front end: nothing really
 <li>Dapp: went through intense reviews.  <ol>

  <li>3-5 people on a call and would go line by line through the code
  <li>Also hired a couple external audits
 <li>Even after all that, found one bug right before launch (a few days before)
<li><strong>What was the hardest part about learning to develop with Ethereum</strong> <ol>

 <li>No real breakdown of how everything works together  <ol>

  <li>Web3 talks to a geth node which has the blockchain state. What does the contract do? How do you deploy it?
  <li>General how stuff works.
<li><strong>What was the first thing you built related to Ethereum, and when did you build it?</strong> <ol>

 <li>Spankchain 4 months ago.
<li><strong>What applications are you most excited about in the near term?</strong> <ol>

 <li>Ours. Spankchain.
<li><strong>What other questions should we be asking?</strong> <ol>

 <li>Why are people building dapps instead of just building them with a normal database or something? 
 <li>What is your motivation for choosing a blockchain based project, instead of just a Postgres database?</li> </ol>

<li><strong>Who are you and what do you do?</strong> <ol>

 <li>Matthew:  <ol>

  <li>Cofounder of Kyokan, CTO  
  <li>Client work
  <li>Plasma and Plasma Chain.
  <li>State channels work with Spankchain.
  <li>Infrastructural work + Solidity.
 <li>Jacky:  <ol>

  <li>Cofounder of Kyokan 
  <li>Building / integrating with Ethereum wallets
  <li>Solidity
<li><strong>Processes and problems for day-to-day work?</strong>
<li>Matthew: <ol>

 <li>Working on plasma and writing it in Go. Focussed on interoperability between Geth and smart contracts.
 <li>My development style:  <ol>

  <li>I really like Java. – enterprise-y tools make me productive.
  <li>IDE could be really improved.   <ol>

   <li>I use IntelliJ's Solidity plugin to edit Solidity.
   <li>"Jump-to-def"; "jump-to-implementation"; syntax highlighting
   <li>Big difference in productivity.
   <li>E.g. when I'm writing Go code, I can jump to the Geth definition. This is amazing.
  <li>I'm switching between Solidity / Go, or Solidity / Javascript   <ol>

   <li>Solidity Javascript bindings through Truffle are good.
 <li>Integrating libraries designed for cryptocurrencies with front-end apps is hard:  <ol>

  <li>Bundle sizing: different behavior if you're running in the browser or in the backend.   <ol>

   <li>E.g. if you compile a contract with truffle, you get a JSON file – which has the bytecode and all this stuff beyond the ABI.    <ol>

    <li>This is heavy and unused.
   <li>Crypto.js has unnecessary dependencies:    <ol>

    <li>Eth.js includes an ASN.1 parser which parses digital certificates –– which isn't needed for any crypto.js uses.
   <li>Google Chrome places a size limit (3 MB) on service workers in Incognito mode.    <ol>

    <li>Bundle sizing is important – need to take out dependencies.
 <li>Standardize the interfaces for all these libraries.  <ol>

  <li>E.g. a standardize library to read BIP39 seed words – across different programming languages.
 <li>Is there a Javascript API to boot a testnet, deploy contracts, and run tests against it?  <ol>

  <li>For running application tests –   <ol>

   <li>I want integration tests that run against Truffle easily
   <li>Having the ability to do this via Javascript is important
   <li>E.g. automate this: <a href="https://github.com/machinomy/machinomy/blob/master/run_integration_tests.sh">https://github.com/machinomy/machinomy/blob/master/run_integration_tests.sh</a>
 <li>People don't know how to productionize a geth node:  <ol>

  <li>On Ubuntu: you can 'apt-get install geth'
  <li>Now, how do you secure it, monitor it, etc?
  <li>People say: "just use Infura" – but then you're tied to Infura.
  <li>Some ideas:   <ol>

   <li>Docker instances; Chef or Ansible scripts; that setup a Geth node which has a bunch of best practices around it.
  <li>As an example:   <ol>

   <li>Your RPC port shouldn't be open to the external world, but should be accessible to the front-end.    <ol>

    <li>You need a layer sitting between the geth node and the external world, and gives: 1) analytics, 2) authentication, and 3) audit logging.
    <li>The dashboard could configure geth on the fly.
   <li>How do you secure a geth node with an RPC port:    <ol>

    <li>Need only certain keys to be allowed to interact with it
<li>Jacky<strong>:</strong> <ol>

 <li>Integrating Metamask with Dapps 
 <li>Building a new wallet for Spank;  <ol>

  <li>It's a service worker   <ol>

   <li>Three threads running at once:    <ol>

    <li>Runs a bunch of background processes
    <li>The Wallet
    <li>The Dapp itself
   <li>The messaging between these three threads sucks.    <ol>

    <li>Cross-window JSON RPC library.
    <li>Wallets are pushing the limits of what Chrome is capable of.     <ol>

     <li>They've had to file two bugs with Chrome in the last month.
   <li>Runs into the service worker size limit.
  <li>Mostly Javascript and Web3 work
  <li>Lot of code repetition in loading state and confirming transactions
  <li>Web3 is kinda hard to use – large ABIs
  <li>Biggest problem has been around event management.
  <li>Key management is not that complicated – Web3 has a good handle on it.   <ol>

   <li>The Web 3 interaction with the wallet:    <ol>

    <li>Web3 provider talks to the blockchain – 
    <li>Spank and Metamask – the provider is an instance of the ZeroClientProvider – written by the Metamask team     <ol>

     <li>The ZeroClient makes all calls when there's no key needed. When a key is needed, it calls into your codebase.
  <li>Biggest problem is around the communication of gas costs.   <ol>

   <li>The UX around this.
   <li>Users pick really high or low gas costs.
   <li>There are better ways to estimate gas.
  <li>Would be nice: currency conversion utility tools.   <ol>

   <li>Existing tools are pretty buggy.    <ol>

    <li>ETH has many different units.
   <li>Units conversion.
<li><strong>What tools / libraries do you use?</strong> <ol>

 <li>Matthew:  <ol>

  <li>I write all my own methods – other than lowdash where I pull specific utils out.
 <li>React / Redux.  <ol>

  <li>Need a way of shoving Web3 stuff into your Redux state. 
  <li>Managing the lock state of your wallet
  <li>E.g. you need the lock-state of the wallet, because the UI changes.   <ol>

   <li>They written a util that queries the wallet, gets it's lock-state, and puts it into the Redux state.
  <li>Authentication: people have public/private keypair; use this data as login.   <ol>

   <li>Having a canonical way to npm install and have authentication build off of Metamask.
 <li>Nice to haves:  <ol>

  <li>Typescript typing for crypto libraries.
  <li>Postgres types to manage Ethereum stuff –– addresses, wei,    <ol>

   <li>Have these methods: .toFinney
<li><strong>What are you excited for?</strong> <ol>

 <li>Plasma: the future is close – will see this live in 3-6 months.
 <li>Generalized state channels: L4 and Spankchain.
 <li>Plasma Cash:  <ol>

  <li>The idea of a coin that you sign over to different parties – it's kind of like a cheque.   <ol>

   <li>Can replace other entrenches business – 
   <li>Can attach it to a stablecoin.
 <li>In-browser Ethereum light-client: Mascara.
 <li>We're in the internet before packet-switching.   <ol>

  <li>After that, everything is open and possible. 
  <li>Can integrate cryptocurrency with your everyday life.</li>  </ol>

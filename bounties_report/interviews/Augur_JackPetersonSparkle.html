<h2>Jack Peterson and Sparkle</h2>

<ol>

<li><strong>What is most frustrating about developing on ETH? </strong>  <ol>

 <li>Lack of a debugger - by far the biggest issue. 
 <li>Need to print things from failing transactions and can't do this.  <ol>

  <li>Right now, we just attempt the transaction until it doesn't fail. We are often unsure why things fail, just keep going until it doesn't. What's missing is break points and executing code from that. That will shorten feedback cycles.  
  <li>Development environment is really bad right now…
<li><strong>Let's talk specifically about UI issues / scaling?</strong> <ol>

 <li>  Stabilisation of contracts: we need clearly defined API's against contracts.  <ol>

  <li>When you change behaviours on a contract it has a multiplicative effect on the UI. One small change can have effect where you change 10 views. This lengthens dev cycles and having an API defined is important.
  <li>In general, it is hard to write business logic layer. Augur is writing a <span class="bounties">middleware node to overcome this.</span>
  <li>Impractical to fetch large amounts of data from blockchain - it's too slow. It takes a minute and half to get data (how do you manage that experience in the UI?). <span class="bounties">Running a remote geth node - fetching data from logs + contracts is not fast either.</span>
  <li>Have an Augur node or SQL database - pre-fetches and pre-processes Augur gnodes to make them available. But this also constitutes an annoying extra thing between ETH and client which can be slow / unusable.
  <li><span class="bounties">Lookup mechanisms are primitive!</span>
 <li>Size limit on contracts is really annoying - can't deploy to Ropsten because of it. It took significant engineering to put something on testnet (had to 51% attack it to increase block size).
 <li>Getting TestNet eth is hard -  not a way to get a good amount of rinkeby (can only get a little bit from faucet - don't want people spamming it with transactions)
 <li>Really intense test suites running against Ropsten (Raiden)  <ol>

  <li>Would be great if we could easily spin up private chain to deal with that. Build a service to spin up private test nest that would have a certain amount of nodes.
  <li>Currently, this takes days of work - what about standard service to do this?? People run these in different setting - EC2 that is configured would be very useful..  Could store copies of Rinkeby and boot them up when people ask for them…  (Infura will evolve into this) 
<li><strong>Brief walk through of the tools you use daily?</strong> <ol>

 <li>Back-end - visual studio code - docker images that run pythereum for unit tests  <ol>

  <li>Solidity compiler - Solium linter everyday
  <li>Integration tests run against Geth/Parity nodes  
  <li>Custom libraries - all their own RPC code.
  <li>No web 3.js (ETH.js libraries are better) 
  <li>Can run locally or dockerized - have a CI pipeline (Travis)
  <li>Push to Github and deploy to Rinkeby
 <li><span class="bounties">Custom deploy tools are a huge headache.</span> Doing a full custom deploy is like launching a satellite into space. There is a huge chasm to cross and a lot of the stuff is non-obvious 
 <li>Truffle is used for this - very challenging because it lacks deep modularity and customizability.  <ol>

  <li>Failed at random on different networks after working reliably against testrpc. It won't tell you why and is deeply opaque. There is no error messaging and it is hard to use in general. The dependency of contracts gets very complicated (because logic is complicated).
  <li>There is definitely more work to get Truffle smooth for everyone 
 <li>Actual contracts / delegate contracts - build system is incredibly specific to their framework and difficult to adapt/customise.	  <ol>

  <li>Use Geth / Parity  
  <li>UI - react / redux.
  <li>Augur node is typescript   <ol>

   <li>Lots of small things - middleware library called <a href="https://github.com/ethereumjs/ethereumjs-blockstream">ethereumjs-blockstream</a>.
   <li>Library for generating keys and key files - <a href="https://github.com/ethereumjs/keythereum">keythereum</a>.    <ol>

    <li>Key management is tough - self signing (so can leave unlocked Geth instance, which is not good either)
<li><strong>What isn't possible with current tools, but would be nice?</strong> <ol>

 <li>Setting breakpoints in tests! 
 <li>Salesforce Development:  Public thing where you post your code to it and everybody works off of it (lots of bounties projects now up from Status Open Bounties to Gitcoin and bounties.network).
 <li>Having clean Dev Nth without 30 things to setup.   <ol>

  <li>React project will need to talk to Geth / IPFS / local = lot of setup is irritating.
  <li>If a transaction fails - logs don't get written = this needs to be in the EVM.
  <li><strong>Having many slacks is a big problem - should have 1 slack with all developers - this in itself is important. Something like this can be done.</strong>
  <li>Documentation is also terrible.  <ol>

   <li>What documentation would you like to see?    <ol>

    <li>Tooling / documentation / community takes like a decade to develop. (Check Kauri for a possible solution)
    <li>"How does Geth estimate Gas" - need to ask a bunch of people and it's not written anywhere.    <ol>

     <li>Need issue for this - doesn't work
    <li>How much gas does a particular operation cost? Is this documented anywhere? (people point you to yellow paper -- very very hard to understand) 
<li><strong>Are you running into problems with any of the following:</strong> <ol>

 <li>Gas Limit - see above.
 <li>Off-chain computation  <ol>

  <li>Moving order books off-chain - order creation and matching.   <ol>

   <li>Settlement is done on-chain 
   <li>Using 0x - Etherdelta style system.
  <li>Haven't launched yet - so not mentioning problems about scaling yet - not relevant yet or thinking about this.
 <li>State Channels  <ol>

  <li>No comment - Raiden
 <li>Issues not addressed so well by Ethereum Foundation - normal software development issues:  Foundation seems unfamiliar with best practices --  <ol>

  <li>Don't communicate about this stuff - "need package manager - way to keep track of versions of what people are building"
<li><strong>What applications do you see as possible in the near term?</strong> <ol>

 <li>Raiden is coming shortly and will be very cool.
 <li>Looking forward to Proof of Steak. 
 <li>UPort going live will be cool on Rinkeby. Is now integrated with Augur.
 <li>Nothing blocking Augur yet.
<li><strong>What process they use for validating the security of their smart contract?</strong> <ol>

 <li>Pay others to think about it - no process yet.  Write a bunch of units tests - going to run things through Oyente (Formal Verification).
 <li>Biggest problem - always has been - test thoroughly and comb through the code. Use static analysis tools. The biggest thing holding us back:  <ol>

  <li>Maybe better standards for writing this stuff (NASA)
  <li>Create linting rules??  
  <li>Have people working on project exhaustively review the code is the only way to do it right now… Certain classes of errors can be caught with unit tests, but they don't catch everything.
<li><strong>What was the hardest part about learning about the blockchain?</strong> <ol>

 <li>What steps do I need to follow to write these apps?  Isn't anywhere here that helps you.  <ol>

  <li>Development cycle for Augur three years - mostly not development stuff. We had first working version of Augur on testnet after 4 months (been iterating since then) 
  <li>Worked but didn't scale and we found security problems. One an't release software with bugs in it. So this weird balance needs to be kept as we can not "move fast and break things"   <ol>

   <li>Start with simple system and iterate on it.
   <li>Only way to do it is to do it on testnet first!  There, you inevitably encounter edge cases or developers notice something.
<li><strong>What would be the hardest part of teaching your Mom how to use a dapp?</strong> <ol>

 <li>How ETH account is different than an account on a regular website.   <ol>

  <li>Few ways to login to Augur - can create an account on the website, but you have to keep track of it (like creating an account on the website).
  <li>Airbit will create accounts for Augur that will behave like regular website. 
 <li>Had 2 bounties - posted on Bounties Network - and it worked!  <ol>

  <li>Linter rules - portable debugger
  <li>Unit tests die and you attach a debugger to it - nobody supports break points.</li>  </ol>

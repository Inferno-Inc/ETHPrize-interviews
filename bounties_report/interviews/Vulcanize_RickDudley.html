<li><strong>What type of apps do you build?</strong> <ol>

 <li>I worked on EthPM briefly.  <ol>

  <li>I gave up in frustration 
  <li>I was working at Monax at the same time with RJ and Jan.
  <li>This is a good bounty that we're going after.
  <li>Bigger problems within EthPM:
  <li>Fundamentally, in Ethereum, we have contract immutability.   <ol>

   <li>If I take the same bytecode and deploy it to two different networks, it's going to have different hashes. So how do I reference the code across my local, testnet, and mainnet environments? How do I reference that in my dev environment? -> the contract address won't be the same.
<li><strong>Two major problems in the community?</strong> <ol>

 <li>Lack of people over 40 – naivete.
 <li>Trust and guarantees – which crypto gives you which guarantees?
 <li>The claims of Ethereum – what features are worth preserving.  <ol>

  <li>Contracts are immutable; but state is mutable –– contract code being mutable doesn't give you any security. -> immutability.
  <li>Is the RChain application model (not Turing complete) better than having a Turing complete VM?
<li><strong>Bottom-up sharding scheme</strong> <ol>

 <li>An app-sharding model.
 <li>Put a market-based order based on parameters on what validators you want.
<li><strong>Working on at the moment?</strong> <ol>

 <li>VulcanizeDB with Maker as their client.
 <li>Steps:  <ol>

  <li>Take IPFS (the content-address allows you to verify the content is correct) and retrieve the data
  <li>SQL query – you do a search given parameters and you get back a result set.   <ol>

   <li>Because you trust the database is free of faults.
  <li>Vulcanize: our result-sets contain content-addressable data.   <ol>

   <li>ETL system for blockchains.
   <li>Pull blockchain data into a Postgres database – load all blocks, transactions, tx receipts.
   <li>You as an engineer write a transformation – which also generates a GraphQL endpoint.
   <li>Your dapp can then pull that data on an ongoing basis live –– pubsub, polling, … The data is also content-addressable.
   <li>e.g. you put the events for a contract into a table, you have a block range, a contract, in this table
   <li>Then, you take that table, do a pg_dump, and put it into IPFS.
   <li>You can then verify that using your own client.
 <li>Github / vulcanize / vulcanize.db  <ol>

  <li>Will be released soon.
 <li>Will eventually write a DSL for those transform.
 <li>Standalone vulcanize db reads from one node, but can gossip the transformed to other nodes.
 <li>Interactions with IPFS, Tendermint, Lightning, …
 <li>Federated exchange – decentralized exchange  <ol>

  <li>Once you have that system; then the Tendermint validators can have a system marketing
  <li>Tendermint validators can be bonded on Ethereum AND they promise to route the Bitcoin HTLCs
<li><strong>Other works?</strong> <ol>

 <li>We haven't been super happy with ganache in particular.
<li><strong>Testing?</strong> <ol>

 <li>I like the DappHub stuff; but it's not fully integrated. 
 <li>There isn't a full testing suite; no way to go from the Solidity integration tests, to full-stack integration tests.
 <li>Casey Detrio worked on testing & fuzzing within Ethereum Foundation codebases.  <ol>

  <li>But they don't run simulation networks on updates, so there could be consensus breaks.   <ol>

   <li>For instance, the airline industry does this. Airlines use BFT within fly-by-wire systems.
 <li>Check out: videos from SQLite author explaining how they did testing.
 <li>Our testing:  <ol>

  <li>We use both Zeppelin and Dapphub. 
  <li>Phantom-js test of something that uses IPFS and Ethereum.
 <li>Monax had a lot of great tools, that didn't get the attention they deserved in the community:  <ol>

  <li>Counterintuitively, the federated context has higher security requirements. Your clients ask tougher questions than ICO token buyers.
<li><strong>Active bounty is a hybrid between a consulting contract & a bounty?</strong> <ol>

 <li>With Github, you have the opportunity to watch source code writing (commits) to deployment on mainnet –– the whole process cryptographically held together</li> </ol>

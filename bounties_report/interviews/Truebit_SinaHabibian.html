<h2>Sina Habibian</h2>

<ol>

<li><strong>What type of apps do you build?</strong> <ol>

 <li>Working on TrueBit. A few smart contracts:  <ol>

  <li>TrueBit core incentive layer: tasks workers who do computation off-chain
  <li>Web-assembly interpreter in solidity
  <li>Building a bridge between dogecoin and Ethereum
 <li>Haven't really started on any front-end stuff for these things.
 <li>Interactive Coin Offering protocol that TrueBit did
<li><strong>How do you test things which interact with the blockchain?</strong> <ol>

 <li>Truffle and Javascript unit tests
 <li>First person to build the contract didn't use truffle, so built his own complete testing system.  <ol>

  <li>Built own testsuite because truffle wasn't configurable enough for my needs: it was running into issues as the complexity of the smart contracts grow
 <li>Deploy things to testnet. Though it's true that there is a limited amount of benefit from deploying to testnet. It that doesn't really test stuff like vulnerable attack vectors or incentive misalignments  <ol>

  <li><span class="bounties">Better to do real testing on the mainnet under a public Beta, using real ETH.</span>
<li><strong>Brief walk through of the tools you use daily?</strong> <ol>

 <li>Vim with solidity syntax highlighter, truffle and travis for tests  <ol>

  <li>Running into problems with truffle on the current project
 <li>Zeppelin's libraries for safe math and tokens. Using some JS state machine libraries for the client.
<li><strong>What isn't possible with current tools, but would be nice</strong> <ol>

 <li><span class="bounties">Testing is so important in this space, but it is so painful and so slow.</span>
 <li>No good debugger!!
 <li>Slow testing and debugging slow down your whole cycle.
<li><strong>What is most frustrating about developing on ETH?</strong> <ol>

 <li>Super slow cycle due to testing.
 <li><strong>Are you running into problems with any of the following:</strong>  <ol>

  <li><strong>Gas limit: </strong>Yes, for local testing enforcing gas limit.
  <li><strong>Off-chain computation: </strong>Yeah.
<li><strong>What process do you use for validating the security of your smart contracts?</strong> <ol>

 <li>A bunch of upfront discussions and security analysis.
 <li>Then writing tests.
 <li>Security audit, bug bounties
 <li>Then, we will run a beta on the mainnet
<li><strong>What was the hardest part about learning to develop with Ethereum</strong> <ol>

 <li>Wrapping my head around potential attacks and edge cases in smart contracts.
<li><strong>What was the first thing you built related to Ethereum, and when did you build it?</strong> <ol>

 <li>January or February of this year, used a tutorial on Medium for creating a voting system  <ol>

  <li>Interesting because the tutorial was already out of date by that point
<li><strong>What would be the hardest part of teaching a software engineer to build a dapp?</strong> <ol>

 <li>Incentives and economics angle is the hardest part to teach people, but likely the most important.
<li><strong>What applications are you most excited about in the near term?</strong> <ol>

 <li>TrueBit because it gives you the ability to run any piece of code and get the result back no matter how long it takes
 <li>ArtDAO  <ol>

  <li>Smart contracts are self owning but don't have any intelligence.
  <li>AI's are evolving and learning, but they don't have any resources.
  <li>AI creates 5 pieces of art and puts them up for auction. Sees the prices.   <ol>

   <li>Keeps making better and better art, and the goal is to maximize how much money it has
<li><strong>Who are other people you think we should talk to?</strong> <ol>

 <li>Dan Finlay</li> </ol>

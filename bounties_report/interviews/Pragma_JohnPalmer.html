<li><strong>What is most frustrating about developing on ETH?</strong> <ol>

 <li>The smoothest user experience happens with MetaMask, but MetaMask has tons of bugs. Regularly need to disable/re-enable MetaMask. Causes a lot of headaches because there is a lot unexpected behavior.
<li><strong>Brief walk through of the tools you use daily </strong> <ol>

 <li>Web3.js 
 <li>0x.js
 <li>Truffle
 <li>Testrpc
 <li>Infura
 <li>Remix Solidity
 <li>Etherscan
<li><strong>What type of apps do you build?</strong> <ol>

 <li>Web applications that interact with smart contracts, usually through MetaMask or Infura.
 <li>We built <a href="www.hashheroes.com">www.hashheroes.com</a> as our first dive into Ethereum.
 <li>We built <a href="www.withpragma.com">www.withpragma.com</a> to make Ethereum development easier.
 <li>We built <a href="www.onhexel.com">www.onhexel.com</a> to make it easier for anyone to experiment with tokens and try new ideas.
<li><strong>How do you test things which interact with the blockchain?</strong> <ol>

 <li>First of all, I write unit tests in javascript and run those locally.
 <li>Interact with smart contract through remix solidity or Pragma.
 <li>Test my app in my own UI. Check etherscan to make sure that happened.
<li><strong>What isn't possible with current tools, but would be nice?</strong> <ol>

 <li>It's not possible to bundle two different transactions together and pay with them at the same time with MetaMask.
 <li>I wish errors in contracts were surfaced better. Generally, it is hard to know when things go wrong in contracts.
<li><strong>Are you running into problems with any of the following:</strong> <ol>

 <li>Gas limit  <ol>

  <li>Wish I could do more within the fallback function. I know it's limited purposefully, but I would like a secure way to execute code in it.
 <li>Off-chain computation  <ol>

  <li>No
 <li>State Channels  <ol>

  <li>No
<li><strong>What applications are you most excited about in the near term (ie. what do you think will be working soon)</strong> <ol>

 <li>Would be really excited to have a mobile metamask. Wallet Connect seems promising on that front.
 <li>Seeing Dapps do live token swaps using 0x (functionally exchanging coins in an application). For example, being able to swap tokens in a game.
<li><strong>What process do you use for validating the security of your smart contracts?</strong> <ol>

 <li>Linting
 <li>Code review on my own and with other people. Check best practices from Consensys
<li><strong>What was the hardest part about learning to develop with Ethereum</strong> <ol>

 <li>Biggest pain point was learning Solidity. Not knowing how everything executed. 
 <li>Not as easy to write something and test it right away, longer feedback loop. 
 <li>Solidity documentation was out of date.
<li><strong>What would be the hardest part of teaching somebody to build a dapp?</strong> <ol>

 <li>Explaining the difference between wallets and contracts, and explaining to them the concept of Gas and how that dictates what they can store in their contract. Explaining how computation works on the network.
<li><strong>Who are other people you think we should talk to (alternative:  Who is the best best developer you know) </strong> <ol>

 <li>Antonio Juliano
 <li>Nick Johnson</li> </ol>

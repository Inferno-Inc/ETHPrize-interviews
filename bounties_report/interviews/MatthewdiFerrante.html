<li><strong>What do you work on?</strong> <ol>

 <li>Audits –   <ol>

  <li>Some clients have their own testnets. Or some chain state that needs to be initialized before you can run the code.
 <li>Smart contract dev –  <ol>

  <li>Decentralized exchange project –    <ol>

   <li>Testing that is hard. You need to deploy onchain; there's a vault, ownership, hierarchy. How does the moving average work? You gotta run a 1000 trades and they have to be from the same account, etc etc
   <li>I wish these tools had a dev mode – where you can deterministically generate accounts    <ol>

    <li>Geth & Truffle & etc should have a 1000 accounts that always show up as the first 1000 accounts.
    <li>E.g. for testing signatures.
    <li>There should be a templated test environment; that you can use across environments, installations, etc.     <ol>

     <li>I find himself editing this a lot.
   <li>People often give me tests which have addresses hard-coded in. I then  have to set it up again.
   <li>Consistency:    <ol>

    <li>Getting projects to sync up; or a tool to initialize the setup for different projects.
    <li>Can use ganache or testrpc upto a certain point, but then, it doesn't scale.
    <li>Something that takes one second to run in geth, takes 20-30s on ganache.
   <li><span class="bounties">A tool that seeds the addresses, accounts –– environment imaging.</span>
<li><strong>PROBLEM #1: how long does it take to setup dev environment & tests</strong>. <ol>

 <li>On my own computer: I don't use 'npm install global' or 'npm' at all –– I've created my own vagrant script, which specifies where I install stuff.
 <li>It takes a long time – 1, 2 hours – to update part of the environment.
 <li>It's a huge barrier to entry
 <li>Also, a huge barrier to experimentation.
 <li>Making something where you can from idea to execution, would be great.
 <li>Remix doesn't work for complex interactions, or with something that's already onchain.
<li>Things get truncated in Javascript.
<li>I wrote my own Python stuff – for handling bignum calculations and submitting to the contract.
<li>We need better support for interaction with contracts that have non-trivial inputs: <ol>

 <li>E.g. if you need to some pre-processing.
<li><strong>Common patterns across projects I'm auditing:</strong> <ol>

 <li>There's limitations to the Solidity compiler – simple fixes could help the rest of the ecosystem make less mistakes:  <ol>

  <li>E.g. imports:    <ol>

   <li>If you import an interface, then you have to link to a contract onchain. Or you can directly import a contract.
   <li>Having a pre-approved list of contracts –– there's no reason to be redeploying things on the chain.
   <li>Ethpm does this – but worth adding support for this in the compiler itself?
 <li>People roll their own complex math:  <ol>

  <li>Because Solidity doesn't have floating point, people come up with binomial approximations etc.
<li><strong>Talk through a complex audit and how the process works:</strong> <ol>

 <li>First: site-read the code.  <ol>

  <li>Notice small details: e.g. there's an unbounded loop here.
 <li>Setup the environment
 <li>Actually execute the code.
 <li>Step through the code with a debugger:  <ol>

  <li>I use EVMLab – shows opcode per line with the state.
 <li>Notes:  <ol>

  <li>I have a lot of hack-ish tools I've built himself. Would be nice to standardize these.
  <li>For audits: I don't look at the offchain stuff.
<li><strong>How do I get testnet eth?</strong> <ol>

 <li>On Ropsten: I have a server.
 <li>Some clients have their own testnets; I forward through their machines
 <li>If I need a lot of testnet eth (eg. testing a reverse dutch auction): I might spin up my own dev net.
<li><strong>Moar?</strong> <ol>

 <li><span class="bounties">Having a setup tool, like truffle init, which initializes keystore and an initial chain state where each of those addresses have a balance.</span> <ol>

  <li>You'd run this after 'npm install', 'truffle init' in your workflow
  <li>Going from 'truffle init' to a working ethereum setup takes too long</li>  </ol>

<li><strong>What type of apps do you build?</strong> <ol>

 <li>90% of my time: design of Solidity language and its implementation
 <li>Formal verification part of the language –  <ol>

  <li>Deprioritized over the last 2 months. Will take on again in April.
 <li>Other projects:  <ol>

  <li>General research   <ol>

   <li>Less research re sharding or plasma – More research on computational scalability of SNARKs, STARKs, Truebit
 <li>Handed off cpp-ethereum to Pavel – not working on it as much.
<li><strong>Tell us more about computational scalability on SNARKs, STARKs, Truebit?</strong> <ol>

 <li>Research on SNARKs implementation – ZoKrates project. Only a PhD student right now – Jacob.  <ol>

  <li>A toolchain for creating ZkSNARK-enabled smart contract
  <li>Need help there, and can pay $ for it.   <ol>

   <li>Why they haven't focused on getting more people, is the project management burden there.
   <li>What kind of help we need:    <ol>

    <li>Implementation.
    <li>The project is a compiler that takes a high-level language, turns it into an arithmetic circuit. It's PoC stage right now. Also needs help with the direction the project needs to go. Needs an evaluation of use-cases.
    <li>Also needs people with cryptography backgrounds who can implement efficient arithmetic circuit gadgets.
    <li>Someone who can deal with Rust as a language; finite-fields.
    <li>Open-source on Github.
    <li>Potential help: university research partners –– Dan Boneh?
  <li>It's early, PoC stage. –– currently the elliptic curve pre-compiles are too pricy.   <ol>

   <li>The first step is to see how much it costs, and if it's feasible because of this.
   <li>Analyze use-cases, and see whether its not too expensive.
   <li>Improve the trusted setup experience.
<li><strong>Solidity?</strong> <ol>

 <li>Development resources: we're pretty much good right now.
 <li>We have issues marked: "good first task" or "help needed" – these are good to pick up by external contributors. They're small in scope, so maybe doesn't make sense for large bounties.  <ol>

  <li>Usually someone creates a PR, we have comments, they update the PR, we make comments, then the contributor loses interest.
  <li>Maybe: could have a person who is responsible for external contribution across all projects?
  <li>Another project: analyze external contributions, and understand why they weren't completed. What was missing in the description / what was the issue? If you're creating an issue for external contributors, what is the detail / info you need so it gets picked up.
 <li>Where we need help:  <ol>

  <li>External people to translate the documentation.   <ol>

   <li>This is a big effort. Requires management. Need to keep translation up to date.
   <li>This doesn't really exist right now. Only have a Russian / Spanish translation that are old and rudimentary.
   <li>There's people to do the translation –– need someone to do the project management.
  <li>More feedback from people who try out the most recent version of Solidity before it is released.   <ol>

   <li>Before – Remix was set to the most recent development snapshot. Now it's set to latest stable, so don't get immediate feedback.
   <li>Truffle and etc only upgrade manually – so its more stable – but slows down the feedback / dev cycle.
   <li>How would this work:    <ol>

    <li>"Reminder: people please try out new versions."
    <li>Way to give feedback exists: creating an issue on Github OR their Gitter channel.
   <li>Most people can't use the latest the version – because the toolset doesn't allow it.    <ol>

    <li>As part of the CI, we're running some tests with specific libraries.
   <li>Possible solution:    <ol>

    <li>People submit their contracts to Solidity team.
    <li>They get integrated into their CI pipeline – every time a new version is pushed, their contract tests are run.
    <li>We get contacted if tests pass re new version working.
  <li>Tools for developing Solidity   <ol>

   <li>It's written in cpp, we usually cmake toolchain for building, cpp-ethereum for semantic tests; thinking about switching to their own interpreter to speed up tests.
   <li>Uses cpp-ethereum with a few extra RPC endpoints. Let's you rewind the blockchain to a particular block. It's also allows you to modify the timestamp in the next block.    <ol>

    <li>They're standardizing these API endpoints. -> include ganache-cli in these discussions?
    <li>Ganache needs to have this ability.
   <li>Having a testing only Ethereum blockchain    <ol>

    <li>Has a memory-only blockchain; is mainly meant to run tests on smart contracts.
    <li>Similar to ganache; but performance could be improved?     <ol>

     <li>Ganache has a UI
     <li>To improve: high-throughput, many txes at once.
<li><strong>Specific ideas that would be helpful?</strong> <ol>

 <li>Gas profiling:  <ol>

  <li>Solidity does some upper-bound gas cost estimation – but its not very useful because it's just an upper bound.
  <li>How to calculate: run the EVM with specific inputs?
  <li>Or: run the function with larger and larger arrays; and find a "gas function" as a function of input size. But this also depends on state.
 <li>Solidity – 16 stack slots issue:  <ol>

  <li>Soon: we'll have structs, and this will be less of an issue.
  <li>When we have IULIA, this requirement will go away.   <ol>

   <li>When IULIA compiles to EVM, it can move variables from stack to memory, after analyzing which is used or not.
   <li>Interesting: IULIA will compile to eWASM.
 <li>Inlining common function calls:  <ol>

  <li>We're conservative when it comes to adding new features in the code generation flow.
  <li>We already have an optimizer for IULIA which does inlining; so that will resolve this.
 <li>The optimizer (in solc) has a switch which decides what to optimize for: code size, execution cost.  <ol>

  <li>This exists, but is rather crude – it assumes every opcode is only run once and this assumption breaks down if you have a loop.
  <li>Have Remco share his 0x example with Christian – and how it could be improved in terms of gas estimation.
 <li>Constant delegation.  <ol>

  <li>Have Remco to share example of hash not being calculated at compile-time.
  <li>Having a good technical writer – who can understand the technical details of Ethereum, and improve the documentation.
  <li>Another model could be to create bounties for improving the documentation. Won't be bounties for a specific issue; but general rewards for improvements to the documentation.
 <li>Improving the documentation for Solidity  <ol>

  <li>They're too deep inside this. Having an external viewpoint would be helpful.
<li><strong>Idea for tool:</strong> being able to test very quickly if a contract implements an interface. <ol>

 <li>The problem is that you cannot enumerate the functions of a contract.
 <li>There's a way to resolve this.
<li><strong>Notes on IULIA:</strong> <ol>

 <li>Compilation from IULIA to EVM is finished.
 <li>Optimizer is 90% finished.  <ol>

  <li>This is why the ABIcoder isn't out yet, because it depends on the optimizer.
 <li>Big remaining chunk of work:  <ol>

  <li>Writing code generator to go from Solidity to IULIA – this is in solc.
 <li>A year away.
<li><span class="bounties">Other bounties:</span> <ol>

 <li>In the research area: due to the way research funding works – people publish the work, but do no maintain the software or integrate with other tools.  <ol>

  <li>Integrating research software with development tooling & keeping them up to date.
  <li>Big example: Formal Verification software   <ol>

   <li>Five or six tools that similar to Oyente.
  <li>Remix has a plugin architecture – possibly supports Oyente.

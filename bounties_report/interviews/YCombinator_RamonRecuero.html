<li><strong>What type of apps do you build?</strong> <ol>

 <li>Last summer, developed Redis on Ethereum. Simple to read & write data. 
<li><strong>What frustrations do you have?</strong> <ol>

 <li>Was pleasantly surprised with Truffle - testing was easier than expected.
 <li>What was hard:  <ol>

  <li>Debugging. Solidity compiler error messages could be better. 
  <li>There's no console.log, can click and step into the code.
  <li>Google and Stack Overflow are often the best resources when running into bugs.
  <li>Trial & error, until you get through it.
  <li>It's difficult to communicate this to other people.
 <li>Getting the mindset for developing for the blockchain is hard.
 <li>Hard to remember,even harder to explain to other people.
 <li>Deploying to testnets and mainnets was hard.  <ol>

  <li>Had trouble with gas.
  <li>Getting Ether on the testnet. No faucet.   <ol>

   <li>Found developer on Reddit Ethereum thread.
  <li>No chance to update the contract. Just pushed new contracts.
 <li>Eth npm in the beginning.
 <li>Different ES6 configurations in front and backend
<li><strong>What surprised you on the other end, what was way easier than expected?</strong> <ol>

 <li>Testing in Truffle.  <ol>

  <li>Was simple coming from the Javascript world.
 <li>Metamask.
<li><strong>How do you test things which interact with the blockchain?</strong> <ol>

 <li>Redis had the smart contract. Made an npm library; had Truffle tests + npm tests.
<li><strong>What process do you use for validating the security of your smart contracts?</strong> <ol>

 <li>Found a list of the top 10 security vulnerabilities; reentrancy, math overflow, ...
 <li>You don't know what you don't know.
 <li>How to find info:  <ol>

  <li>Google / reading about the DAO hack / Reddit.
<li><strong>Who are other people you think we should talk to?</strong> <ol>

 <li>Blockchain Berkeley Lab – professor – working with students learning blockchains.
<li><strong>What other questions should we be asking?</strong> <ol>

 <li>Share your learnings, get the community back in, and do another iteration.
<li><strong>Other bounties:</strong> <ol>

 <li>Have code, gas station –
 <li>Having difficulty in hiring people – most engineers don't understand blockchain.  <ol>

  <li>Don't have much to show for it right now.   <ol>

   <li>SoV --
  <li>Infrastructure needs to get exist first.   <ol>

   <li>security.. 
  <li>Lack of use-case.. 
<li><strong>Misc</strong> <ol>

 <li>Explaining the data model for blockchains:  <ol>

  <li>E.g. similar to: Dan Abramov: Redux devtools on the right.
  <li>Making an interactive demo of data flowing through.
  <li>Did Coursera course to implement blockchain.</li>  </ol>

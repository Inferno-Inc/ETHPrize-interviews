Dandelion has only a bit of experience in the Ethereum ecosystem, so this interview was a bit pared down compared to others and is from the beginner in blockchain perspective.
</p><ol>

<li><strong>What type of apps do you build?</strong> <ol>

 <li>SourcCred - bounties and reputation for open source work.
 <li>Earn ethereum cred - reputation in the eth ecosystem for different projects  <ol>

  <li>Fair distro of tokens based on who developed the project
  <li>Analyse history and collect social feedback to refine the process
<li><strong>Tools libraries, frameworks?</strong> <ol>

 <li>IPFS & filecoin separate business layer (fs and file retrieval) from incentive layer. Same thing with SourceCred. We want tokens to flow according to a software infrastructure graph.  <ol>

  <li>Tokens flow according to software dep graph
  <li>Need a fair transparent way for who determines credit for a project. How can we create tools for determining who earns credit in a fair way? Using algo and data collection. Been in Node ecosystem to parse data out of Github. Try to implement Pagerank on files, pull requests, function level, etc. Using TensorFlow for cred.
  <li>Connect GH ids to eth addresses eventually
<li><strong>Try to remember the last time you developed a feature for ethereum and you ran into some unexpected obstacle. What was it? How did you feel?</strong> <ol>

 <li>Interested in Being able to correctly map Github identities to Ethereum addresses. Was thinking about developing an ad hoc key-based style proof, post a specific gist so that you prove you hold the account.
<li><strong>What really frustrates you or makes you mad about the ecosystem?</strong> <ol>

 <li>Highly adversarial environment makes it hard to feel safe. Wants to develop SourceCred outside of blockchain as much as possible before moving to Ethereum as late as possible. A misstep in the Ethereum ecosystem could have disastrous effects for project.
<li><strong>What type of apps do you build?</strong> <ol>

 <li>Currently a "regular" web front-end and back-end with plans to move the backend to blockchain in near future after proof-of-concept, doesn't want to host a centralized server
<li><strong>What isn't possible with current tools, but would be nice?</strong> <ol>

 <li>At core abstractions layer. If SourceCred depends on Foo library. Every time I mint SouceCred tokens, I want to give SourceGrain token to not only contributors to SourceCred but also the Foo library. But in Blockchain it is very difficult to Iterate over all of the objects.
<li><strong>What education resources are you using to develop with Ethereum?</strong> <ol>

 <li>CryptoZombies really improved my intuition.
<li><strong>What was the first thing you built related to Ethereum, and when did you build it? </strong> <ol>

 <li>Only tutorial level familiarity at the moment
<li><strong>What really pisses you off about ETH development?</strong> <ol>

 <li>It would be really great to see better documentation and more static typing in the ecosystem.

<li><strong>What type of apps do you build?</strong> <ol>

 <li>VirtuePoker –– making the migration to the new problem.  <ol>

  <li>We have a Proof-of-Concept on Python; implementing in Electron.
  <li>Talking to Plasma, to use for scaling and also gas costs. This is a big problem.   <ol>

   <li>The poker game actions are all done off-chain; the money stuff is on-chain. The winner reports the results. This is on-chain and expensive. Even reporting on the results costs $1.
  <li>Offchain stuff:   <ol>

   <li>P2P network between all the peers – just a centralized API right now. Later want to be p2p without a server, but could have attack vectors with people listening in.
  <li>Building the backend – regulatory process – if you lose a hand, but thought you won, you should be able to call in. Also to prevent collision. View patterns.
 <li><strong>Try to remember the last time you developed a feature for ethereum and you ran into some unexpected obstacle. What was it? How did you feel?</strong>  <ol>

  <li>Gas costs:   <ol>

   <li>Ethereum price increased, gas priced also increased, then CryptoKitties launched –– gas cost of $1. We think the only solution is Plasma.    <ol>

    <li>In the beginning, it'll be only a chain for payout. Won't have the EVM. The first Plasma implementation won't be a EVM – will be only for sending payments.
    <li>We'll be moving from this to a payment-only architecture.
  <li>Documentation is very weak – Plasma especially.   <ol>

   <li>New joiners, suffer when learning. Compared with, say, Javascript.
   <li>Especially since we're all in a phase where new developers are entering.
   <li>Ethereum Foundation examples has not changed in a long time.
  <li>There's no rollback when you deploy a contract.   <ol>

   <li>Deployment costs of a contract is expensive – the Dutch Auction for their ICO costs 1 ETH to deploy.
   <li>We were using Truffle to test. Achieved 97% code coverage.    <ol>

    <li>Testrpc. Mining a lot of blocks.
  <li>Testing code based on temporal logic, number of blocks, e.g. you want to protect funds for 90 days or so..   <ol>

   <li>Can achieve same result with 20/30 minutes of blocks.
   <li>This kind of testing is really slow.
<li><span class="bounties">Other bounties:</span> <ol>

 <li>How to simplify the way to calculate the gasPrice.  <ol>

  <li>Having an estimateGasCost when you send a transaction?
 <li>A lot of people have trouble when sending a transaction with a low gas cost, doesn't get accepted – but you can replay the same tx with the same nonce with higher gas price and overwrite  <ol>

  <li>Wallets need to implement this, it would help a lot of people.
<li><strong>Misc</strong> <ol>

 <li>Testing our Dutch Auction ICO contract:  <ol>

  <li>We were targeting 100% code coverage.
  <li>The contract allowed ICO to stop in two ways:   <ol>

   <li>By hitting the market cap
   <li>By calling stop (?)
  <li>The time between the auction being finished, and the tokens being claimed, you want 7 days.   <ol>

   <li>This is equivalent to 30k blocks.
   <li>How to test? You hardcode lower numbers, test (which is slow), then switch in the real numbers.
  <li>What a solution for this would look like:   <ol>

   <li>These tools could have a way to mine the number of blocks you want, instead of block-by-block.
 <li>Stress-testing the economics & game theory of ICO contract:  <ol>

  <li>To be able to bid, you need to be whitelisted. Then, the amount you bid is also limited.
 <li>Solidity:  <ol>

  <li>It's a simple language. Not very complex. Problem is you have to be very strict about testing everything; not even leaving a single line of code without coverage.   <ol>

   <li>E.g. Parity bug. All contracts where using the same contract.
   <li>E.g. if you want to use an external function of a contract, and that person kills the contract, you are screwed. Kinda like someone deleting an NPM package you depend on. But there's no roll back.
   <li>We are moving towards factory or library-driven contracts.    <ol>

    <li>We will have a proxy contract.</li>    </ol>

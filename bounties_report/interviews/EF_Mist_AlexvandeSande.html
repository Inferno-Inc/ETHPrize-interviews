</p><ol>

<li><strong>What type of apps do you build?</strong> <ol>

 <li>Working on Mist, the Ethereum browser.  <ol>

  <li>Developers contributing open-source.
  <li>There's a wall between core team & open-source team.   <ol>

   <li>Would love for people to be paid reliably for features.
  <li>3 Developers. Talk on Discord.
  <li>Current experimentations in paying open-source developers:   <ol>

   <li>Colony
   <li>Commit F
   <li>We want beter Github integration. Now possible with Status Open Bounties and Gitcoin etc.
<li><strong>Try to remember the last time you developed a feature for ethereum and you ran into some unexpected obstacle. What was it? How did you feel?</strong>  <ol>

  <li>One dev working on a backend integration – I stopped working on this to work on one issue – "password wasn't working for user" – couldn't reproduce the bug. Could put a bounty for someone to recreate the bug & solve it.
  <li>Different systems: Gitter, Github issues, different wallets 
  <li>How we solved: created a single issue with all comments from other issues. Created google form for anyone who had an issue, to see if there's a pattern amongst problems.
  <li>What type of expertise is needed for this: we don't have enough security oriented people on our team. We passed the bug reports to the Foundation security person, who tests them.   <ol>

   <li>Single case: serious bug report came in and was fixed. But couldn't test the fix, because they would have run exploit on their machines. They don't have pen testers.
   <li>Wanted – less of a wall between their team and the outside.
   <li>Need:  Recurring open source developers --- that are working for bounties --     <ol>

    <li>They haven't tried bounties yet.
    <li>Is the problem: dev awareness or payment?
    <li>They're making app more modular.
<li><strong>How do you test things which interact with the blockchain?</strong> <ol>

 <li>People build new features, we check, and then approve it.
 <li>We've had issues – 
 <li>Meteor.js migrating to React.
<li><strong>Who are other people you think we should talk to?</strong> <ol>

 <li>Nick Johnson 
 <li>Ryan Zurrer
<li><strong>Other bounties?</strong> <ol>

 <li>Finding talented people is very hard. They are in such high demand. Trying to get people out of school. Online courses in Solidity.  <ol>

  <li>Web developers, software engineers.
  <li>Separate recruiting approaches for the Foundation.
<li><strong>What pisses you off?</strong> <ol>

 <li>Securing Electron (desktop JS) was hard. (JS in website can take over your system - happens with chrome)
 <li>Integrating with other technologies: IPFS, Swarm, etc. Frustrating that they are all in their early days.
 <li>Information overlap - this is a major problem - e.g. in keeping up-to-date with Solidity developments, even though I'm on the Foundation.  <ol>

  <li>A lot of people have been trying to integrate this information without success 
  <li>I like two things from the Foundation:   <ol>

   <li>1) daily standup for Geth team.
   <li>2) every quarter Vitalik and Ming post an update on what happened in the Foundation.
  <li>To be improved at the Foundation:   <ol>

   <li>1) On the operational side:    <ol>

    <li>Make the foundation more open, more modular with their finances. Each team should have more autonomy, with their finances transparent on the blockchain.
   <li>On the technical side:    <ol>

    <li>Autonomy would play into this as well.
  <li>What are you excited about:   <ol>

   <li>Casper.
   <li>Sharding.
   <li>Applications: Aragon, MakerDAO.</li>   </ol>

<h2>Hudson Jameson</h2>

<ol>

<li><strong>What type of apps do you build:</strong> <ol>

 <li>Mainly focused on solidity smart contracts. A little node JS and Java but not very good at it.
<li><strong>How do you test things which interact with the blockchain: </strong> <ol>

 <li>Have been using Truffle more lately but was mostly just using Remix before.
 <li>Write the contracts in Remix, deploy them in Remix. Usually do it all through Remix and MetaMask. Used to connect metamask to a ropsten node run locally, but now metamask is more reliable.
<li><strong>Brief walk through of the tools you use daily</strong> <ol>

 <li>Remix, MyEtherWallet, MetaMask
<li><strong>What isn't possible with current tools, but would be nice</strong> <ol>

 <li>Remix combines an editor with a deployment mechanism and that's what I like about it.
 <li>EthMix was like a full IDE with better syntax highlighting and better debugging. And it was a native app instead of web-based. Pity that it has not been maintained.
 <li>Something that automatically uploads the contract to ES
<li><strong>What is most frustrating about developing on ETH? (Specifically - talk about UI issues / scaling)</strong> <ol>

 <li>Hard to read error messages. Solidity and EVM might fix this with error messages.
 <li><strong>Are you running into problems with any of the following:</strong>  <ol>

  <li><strong>Gas limit:</strong> Totally. If you don't properly separate your contracts or import too many, the gas limit blocks you. Especially on Ropsten with a dynamic gas limit, this doesn't work.
  <li><strong>Off-chain computation: </strong>Many things can't be done until TrueBit becomes a real thing. Biggest one being stuff like Plasma and side chains aren't possible until TrueBit is ready.
  <li><strong>State Channels: </strong>Haven't worked with them personally but understand them and think they're cool.
<li><strong>What process do you use for validating the security of your smart contracts?</strong> <ol>

 <li>Use the Remix tool to just scan for general bugs.
 <li>Wanted to use Oyente, but don't know how to use it  <ol>

  <li>Remix is thinking about being modular to the point where you can just plug in your own about module - that would be awesome to see.
<li><strong>What was the hardest part about learning to develop with Ethereum</strong> <ol>

 <li>The resources are pretty spread out, and everything moves so fast it's hard to keep up today. If you're using resources from 6 months ago they might be wildly out of date.
<li><strong>What was the first thing you built related to Ethereum, and when did you build it?</strong> <ol>

 <li>February of 2015 (2016?) for a bank. Comparison proof of existence code, done with solidity. Did this as part of a team.
 <li>Andreas Olafson had the only videos and tutorials on solidity, so I just watched those to learn.
<li><strong>What applications are you most excited about in the near term?</strong> <ol>

 <li>Casper. It's already kind of going into testing.
 <li>TrueBit near the top of the list because it has so much potential.
<li><strong>Who are other people you think we should talk to?</strong> <ol>

 <li>Raine Revere from ShapeShift
<li><strong>Dev Grants:</strong> <ol>

 <li>Ethereum foundation had 2 iterations of this program
 <li>Get some money to build something at the protocol-level
 <li>The foundation is looking into revising the process.</li> </ol>

# ETHPrize

ETHPrize is a community research and bounty project that identifies the most critical issues facing the ethereum ecosystem and organizes bounties to solve them.

There are no leaders, no bosses, no orders to follow. There is just initiative, participation and kindness.

This repo contains both the website and a living report we are creating containing the interview notes from over 80 of the top developers actually #buidling cool things in the ecosystem.

Feel free to look through them at your leisure - there is some really great information and potential opportunities to be found. If you are one of the interviewees (or feel that you should be) please send a PR at any time to update the information contained in there so that we can keep an up-to-date, canonical reference of what the biggest frustrations for developers are and what most needs to be fixed or built next.
